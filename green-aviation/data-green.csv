How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,CAS Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity  1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiency CO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable.  Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s. Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25  of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density.

Source  TTT Green Aviation proposal",,"the pitch is high temperature PEM Fuel cell for aviation. Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy. It causes pollution and release carbon dioxide into the air, which causes global warming. This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution. When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission. However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide. The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1 4 of hydrocarbon fuel.

Hydrogen Fuel Aerogel Storage Tanks (HyFAST) ,CAS Wicked Wild,High,"Current challenges to (zero carbon) Hydrogen Aircraft fuel storage development often becomes a materials science engineering issue. Hydrogen poses challenges related to material compatibility, as it can cause hydrogen embrittlement in certain metals used for cryotanks. This can impact the structural integrity of components over time, necessitating the development of materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. Also, hydrogen is highly flammable, and safety is a paramount concern, especially in the aviation industry. In addition to these materials issues, hydrogen storage also creates a challenge for volume occupation and transport safety.

Utilize porous polymer aerogels as a host system for safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. Incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage tanks for structural enhancement, vibration damping, and fire retardancy. ","So with this concept, we were looking at a greener, cleaner, more sustainable environment and a lot of times that equates to lowering carbon emissions. And one of the biggest focuses for lowering carbon emissions would be alternative fuels, and hydrogen has gotten. It's a tremendous amount of attention throughout arrow and commercial industries, and so some of the current challenges to using 0 carbon hydrogen are it's fuel storage capabilities. And so the development often becomes a material science and engineering issue, and having a background in polymer science, I I believe that this could be maybe remedied through some kind of material capable compatibility. Currently, when you're using hydrogen, because of the pressures and temperatures that you have to keep it at, you can often cause embrittlement in certain materials, especially metals that they're currently using for cryo tanks. So obviously this impacts the structural integrity of the components over time and now you need a you need materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. In addition, some of the other issues with hydrogen high flammability, which is obviously creates a safety concern and also the storage because of the volume occupation. That's necessary pressures and and and everything that involves keeping hydrogen in its liquid form in order for transport. This created transport safety issue. So what if you could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety and efficiency, and to remedy to be a partial remedy for some of these problems that are obvious in in aeronautics, we suggest using lightweight polymer aerogels for storage.  Now one of the biggest reasons why is because if you utilize a porous polymer in especially a porous polymer aerogel as a host system for liquid hydrogen, you create a safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. And also you can incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage storage tanks, which is a big focus for NASA. And you can create a higher structural integrity and enhanced vibration damping and also incorporate certain polymers for fire retardant seem. what you're looking at now is the potential for some multifunction material like aerogels that not only addresses thermal resistance and and chemical capability, but it could offer energy absorption, vibration damping and lightweight structural reinforcement. And especially with external fuel storage and tanks or pads, this can help remedy the volume requirements for storage, especially with transport which is which is an issue, the polymer aerogels just to quickly let you know if if you're that person out there that doesn't know what ardella is, it's a it's a 3 dimensional structure comprised of a network of of self assembled polymer, which results in a very high porosity which we target over 95  large internal surface areas.  it's a nanoscale pore size, which anywhere from 10 to 20 nanometers the actual the picture, which with the fuel tank is the background is an actual error. low density, low thermal conductivity and excellent wedding and storage capabilities and just very quickly. You can see that it pairs well with liquid propellants that have with these chemically and thermally resistant polymers. The high porosity and nanoscale pore sizes give the advantage of housing a liquid propellant in a way that it can encase it so that it actually appears as a handles like a solid. So no slashing and low boil off, and again the structural integrity of the error gels which we see over 200 megapascal compressive modulus within the external storage tanks can reduce the overall weight and also improve efficiency and safety while expanding volume capability and the range limits of the craft.",,

","I'm talking about heat generation. That's inherent to any process, and specifically in this context, the excess heat generated throughout an aircraft as NASA and countries around the globe look to sustainable aviation to address greener climate and environmental initiatives, we can also shift our perspective on heat generated by engines, batteries and other aircraft components from being a detriment or a flaw to the generated heat being designed feature. Here we have an opportunity to employ energy harvesting as part of an integrated multifunctional system to support our electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation, as well as moving a few degrees closer to closing the loop on sustainability. With that, we can address the desirability, viability and feasibility of taking on this opportunity. As for the desirability, or do they want this energy conversion technology, this technologies as a part of an integrated aircraft system is not a new concept. NASA and companies like Boeing have previously demonstrated interest in the area at the bottom right, doctor Arun Malay of Boeing laid out an aircraft system map to demonstrate the potential of a thermal management system to capture and utilize generated heat, and even now with the the electrification, the aviation batteries introduced a significant source of thermal energy. That one harvested could support secondary systems while simultaneously mitigating and preventing thermal runaway and catastrophic damage. Supported systems could further include comprehensive structural health monitoring, lighting and deicing.

Imagine the nervous system of a body completely connected and optimized to regulate temperature and subsystem functions and aviation wasted energy from thermal motion and other energy sources will be harvested for secondary functions to enhance electrification and sustainability initiatives.

Source  Wicked Wild pitch",,"Today I want to propose the idea of using optical fiber for temperature sensing for electric 5 vehicles. Right now I wanna paint the point that air transportation is is a significant amount of carbon emission for for the aerospace industry and aerospace for for aeronautics. Basically, they want to reduce the carbon emission and one of the great ways of doing this is electric file. The aircraft vehicle. Uh, but, but in order to do that, transition that into electrified vehicle, there is a lot of obstacles. First of all, the if you are doing a short term, kind of like a short range flight, you're looking at a battery. Electric vehicles, which are traditional using a lithium ion battery chemistry, but then these are different than electrical vehicles. When when you have a a runaway, then on lithium ion battery you can just pull over and get out of the car. But if you are on the middle of a flight, that's that's really not ideal. So so you would want to have a a system to monitor whenever you have a better resell that is not performing well with elevated temperatures you you can have active way to monitoring and now go into the other way if you want to do a long term long haul transportation. One of the ways that that a lot of aerospace company i.e. Airbuses is is working on is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle where you use hydrogen as a fuel source and then you use the fuel cell in order to to sustain the the airplane for for long haul transportation. Now you now you have a new type of fuel with hydrogen. You have to liquefy the hydrogen and you would need some sort of way to have the high spatial density in order to measure the the the the temperature level across the liquid hydrogen and then the the the fuel line of the liquid hydrogen. So so for the future aircraft, we could now you you want to get to a way to to monitor temperature. So the pitch that I wanna make is we already have fiber optic sensing technology that has a high spatial density and good thing about the fiber is completely optical. It won't cause or affect by electromagnetic interference that that the X57 team at Armstrong has been experiencing and just the proposal. Now you can use these optical fiber to integrate it into your high current wire that gave a lot of heat. So you you can use it to monitor battery. You can use it to monitor the wires that you have on to your airplane. So so that you have proof of confidence that you won't have a runaway effect and you would have a new paradigm shift in sensing suite that you instead of doing like a specific discrete point onto some layers of your wire. Now you have you you have a temperature distribution every half inch interval across your your airplane.",,

Battery Pack Modelling,TTT Green Aviation,,"Battery Pack Modelling Proposal Electro-Chemical   Structural-Thermal pack modelling proposal for TTT   Green Aviation Call, 2023 1) Problem, Objectives, Approach, and Anticipated Benefits  Many of novel aircraft concepts include some degree of electrification to reduce carbon footprint. To date, the battery models that have been able to be incorporated into NASA aircraft preliminary design studies such as the quadrotor0F 1 have been cell-level models1F 2, with knockdown factors for pack-level effects. There is an interest from EPFD, TTT, AATT, and other projects, in being able to more accurately model and optimize pack-level structural and thermal effects in addition to the cell-level effects. However, to date, there was no clear path on how this could be accomplished while still being compatible with cutting edge gradient-based aircraft optimization tools like OpenMDAO2F 3 and Aviary3F 4. The objective of this research proposal is to create an open-source battery pack model that includes cell electro-chemical effects as well as pack-level structural-thermal effects. The resulting model will be differentiable to ensure compatibility with OpenMDAO and Aviary. Our approach is to create a multi-center team and use open-source tools that we are already familiar with to create a system-level battery pack design. Figure 1 shows an Extended Design Structure Matrix (XDSM) diagram that details of how each of the component disciplines fits together to make the overall battery-pack model. In Figure 1, Discharge curves from cell-tests are input into the cell electro-chemical model which allows for the configuration of the parameters of the cell and later analysis. The cell electro-chemical effects based on models from ProgPy4F 5. A CAD model of the pack (multiple cells) is then created and imported along with the number of packs into the structural-thermal model TACS5F 6. The TACS software performs structural analysis to evaluate the mass of the pack as well as configure parameters for use later in the analysis. At this point the battery pack will be run through a sample mission which will primarily consist of pulling a specified quantity of amps at a particular voltage from the system over a given amount of time. During the mission, the cell electro-chemical model will keep track of the state of charge and voltage of the cells. TACS will keep track of the temperature throughout the pack subject to the heat produced by each cell and a assuming a constant cooling flow. Figure 2 (left) shows an example compliant battery pack designed and (right) a TACS structural-thermal pack model. Both of these models were designed by team members on this proposal. 1 E.

This will enable better understanding of the trade-space for electrified aircraft studies. Additionally, by open sourcing the model and publishing a paper on it, this will provide other researchers in government, academia and industry with an understanding of how they can use the same methods to create their own higher fidelity battery pack models. 2) Milestones and how to Evaluate Success    January 2024   CAD Battery pack model completed   April 2024   Cell electro-chem model input constraints narrowed to decrease multimodality of solution space.

Preliminary paperwork filed for open-source release. SciTech 2025 abstract submitted.   September 2024   Battery pack optimization completed. Optimization will vary wall thickness in one or more parts of the pack model. The optimization objective will be minimum mass while completing the mission objective based on a pre-determined voltage and amperage draw. Repository is released open source. 3) Next Steps and Areas for Transition  Completion of this work through open-source code release and publishing in SciTech 2025 would immediately enable TTT, AATT, and EPFD projects to use the pack-level model created to investigate specific battery pack and cell chemistries for electrified aircraft studies like the TTBW. This is a higher level of fidelity than they can currently achieve with the cell-only models that currently exist. Additionally, academic partners like U. Michigan, Georgia Tech, and Iowa State, could immediately take the models created from this work and integrate them into their electrified aircraft studies that they perform on an ongoing basis using simplified battery models. Further work would need to be performed in order to parameterize the pack-model into something that could handle changing the number of cells inside the pack without engineer input. CAD modelling of the pack, while useful for an initial design, is a time-consuming process that parametrization should help to simplify. Additionally, parameterization enables the optimizer to trade battery pack design for other aspects of the aircraft like thermal system mass and wing volume. 4) Challenge Scenario In the case where a subset of the analysis was infeasible, (i.e. if ProgPy was not capable of supplying the cell electro-chemical models but the other aspects of the thermal-structural analysis were working well,) we would use one of our other cell models or create a new cell model as a substitute. This scenario has happened multiple times in the past with other projects and we have been successful at finding substitute models. In the case where the entire approach was invalid, we could shift our focus to leveraging an already working battery cell model and enhancing it with better pack-level estimates for weight. While this would not be as thorough as analyzing the full structural-thermal system, it would still provide for increased fidelity which will provide useful for aircraft design studies. Regardless of what challenges appear before the team during this work, the entire team will be involved in the decision-making process of how to pivot and still create useful advancements in battery pack modelling for electrified aircraft design.",,,,,,
Effects of Atmospheric Conditions and Sustainable Fuels on Contrail Radiative Forcing,TTT Green Aviation,,"1 TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL Title  Effects of Atmospheric Conditions and Sustainable Fuels on Contrail Radiative Forcing 1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Executive summary Contrails create about two-thirds of aviation s contribution to climate change. To guarantee the success of contrail mitigation strategies such as flight altitude changes, the sensitivity of contrail optical depth to atmospheric parameters must be quantified with the associated uncertainty. Additionally, impact from both SAF and hydrogen needs to be studied  Are future aviation fuels more or less prone to contrails? We address these concerns by applying modeling, simulation, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to contrails to assess and reduce the aviation s impact on global warming. What problem are you solving? Current estimates of the anthropogenic radiative forcing (RF) due to aviation are crippled by a very high level of uncertainty. This uncertainty comes from non-CO2 processes in the formation and persistence of contrails 1 . To address it rigorously, the influence of the local atmospheric conditions (which are only known up to a certain degree of confidence from weather models) must be propagated through contrail simulations. Similarly, the effect of the chemical composition of the jet exhaust gas (also a large source of uncertainty) must be factored in to enable predictions for different types of engines and fuels, such as SAF and H2, and unconventional aircraft technologies, such as Quesst. Eventually, we aim to predict the optical properties of the contrails and the related confidence interval, given uncertain inputs. Has someone tried to solve this problem before? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not? Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of contrails has been performed in several research groups (reviewed in  2 ). The current state-of-the-art methodologies can handle contrails from conventional airplanes using regular jet fuels. To alleviate computational cost, contrail simulations typically use a time-developing framework, where the streamwise direction of the flow is replaced by periodicity conditions. Assuming Galilean invariance, the simulation is performed in a moving frame with a constant translation speed equal to the free stream velocity. Figure 1  Spatially developing wake simulation using VPM  3 .  2 Where did they go wrong? 1. No formal quantification of the uncertainty has been performed to date. At most, simple parametric studies have been conducted  4 . 2. Only few works have simulated contrails from SAF  5 , and virtually none from H2. There is a need to improve simulation codes and models so they can handle situations with fewer aerosols and or soot particles which in turn affect the nucleation and growth of ice particles. 3. The effect of the time-developing assumption on the simulation results has never been quantified. However, it impedes physical processes that involve axial velocities (since they are not Galilean invariant). Consequences on the mixing in the plume and the ensuing contrail RF must be studied. What is different about your approach? How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches? Our simulations will address the above shortcomings as follows  1. Use of QUEST (NASA UQ software) to propagate uncertainty through the simulations. 2. Use of a Lagrangian super particle approach to deal with the microphysics of ice nucleation in a variety of environments, with different concentration of aerosols soot particles and diverse background conditions (humidity, temperature, stratification, etc.), specifically targeting the microphysics of SAF and H2 contrails. 3. Use of a Vortex Particle-Mesh (VPM) approach to perform regular space developing simulations (as opposed to time-developing) at a moderate computational cost (Figure 1) and quantify the model error associated with the time-developing assumption by comparing with regular LES performed with the code NTMIX. In these efforts we will collaborate with Stanford Univ. (Dr. Tania Ferreira, Prof. Catherine Gorle, Prof. Juan Alonso) and Poly. Montreal (Prof. Roberto Paoli) to cross-validate our simulations and models. If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Our simulation results will lead to parameterizations and surrogate models based on machine learning (ML) techniques trained on our simulation results. Such models can then be used to improve climate models and devise efficient contrail mitigation strategies (see sect.3). Potential customers  FAA, airframe and engine manufacturers, policy planners, etc. 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   Description Exit criteria 1 Generate high-fidelity LES of aircraft wakes in a stratified atmosphere   engine exhaust vapor depositing onto ice crystals (NTMIX code). Code working and validated against canonical benchmark. 2 Incorporate stratification and engine vapor into a VPM method for rapid predictions. Perform spatially developing simulations using VPM and compare with the time-developing LES results. Code working and validated against canonical benchmark. Time-developing model error quantified. 3 Vary ambient stratification, temperature, humidity, atmospheric turbulence, and fuel type. Use UQ to sample the parameter space and obtain uncertainty bounds. LES and VPM results compared and validated against observations (e.g., ND-MAX). 3 4 Extract a parametrization surrogate of contrail optical depth versus the atmospheric parameters for each fuel. Model available as a set of equations or a numerical implementation. 5 Analyze uncertainty with respect to the aerosol content and ice nucleation modes of hydrogen SAF combustion Study ready to be published disseminated. 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?   Our parameterization should be implemented in global circulation models to better quantify the nonCO2 impact of aviation on climate change and the related uncertainty.   Air traffic trajectory should be optimized under uncertainty. Mitigating non-CO2 effects is challenging because it usually increases direct CO2 effects. Efficient strategies should use the information about uncertainty from our models to target the operational adaptations that have the highest likelihood of making a positive overall impact. This connects with the transition goals of ATM-X.   Future research should focus on reducing the uncertainty in the inputs to our models. One example is the predicted humidity at high altitude, which will require refinement of current weather simulation and forecasting methods. 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? Let us first note that    Two independent simulation codes will be used  NTMIX and VPM. This mitigates the risk since it is highly unlikely that neither will work for the intended problem. Both codes have been used in the past for similar problems.   If UQ does not work with QUEST, other software can be used such as DAKOTA.   If ML does not work for the parameterization (e.g., because too much data is required to train the model), we can rely on more conventional method for surrogate modeling such as kriging. In the unlikely event that the initial approach is unfeasible because none of the simulation codes work, we could redirect the focus of this project in several ways. For example    Contrails can only persist in the atmosphere in ice super-saturated regions (ISSR). Predicting the position and spatial extent of these ISSR is notoriously difficult. We could work on improving the modeling of ISSR using a combination of numerical weather predictions, observational data, and machine learning.   The interaction between a contrail, the ensuing contrail cirrus, and natural cirrus clouds is not well understood. We could work on improving ice mixed cloud modeling using Lagrangian capabilities like those we envisioned for the proposed work. References   1  D.S. Lee, D.W. Fahey, A.

"Improved Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) Simulations for Design, Analysis and Optimization of Both Airframe and Propulsor",TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   Title  Improved Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) Simulations for Design, Analysis and Optimization of Both Airframe and Propulsor   Description of the work    Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) at NASA is inadequate for addressing subsonic transport Mach numbers and higher, as well as distortion for blades with a lot of twist consistent of typical high bypass ratio turbofans for relatively quick design-study or optimization types of runs.  PAI capability for design understanding is critical for getting improved performance of aircraft and to meet key sustainability goals of NASA. The current codes have actuator disk capability for steady simulations which are inadequate or have the ability to run time accurate with rotating blades installed but require thousands of CPUs and thousands of CPU GPU hours to run.     The Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD), a TTBW configuration is designated as the X-66A as shown on the left of Figure 1.  It consists of a Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan.  That configuration can be simulated under existing cruise conditions using existing NASA CFD tools where the propulsor can be modeled as either an actuator disk or with appropriate boundary condition at the Nacelle inlet and exhausts.  Crosswind configurations or very high angles of attack will be more difficult or not possible with those same tools.  On the right of Figure 1 is the Open Fan concept engine that GE is currently developing in their partnership with CFM International.  Having this architecture engine on the TTBW and simulating with existing NASA tools would not produce an accurate description of the interaction unless one spent months getting one unsteady result.  This capability is not only lacking at NASA, but in the industry as well.  Improved PAI simulation capability that can be done relatively quickly can allow for reduced fuel burn through modifications of the propulsor and airframe at the same time.   A blue and white airplane  Description automatically generated with low confidence A black and white spider  Description automatically generated with medium confidence   Figure 1.  On the left is the TTBW in X-66A configurationwith the turbofans with Nacelles.  On the right is the GE RISE concept OpenFan (image from CFM International).        Two NASA codes are widely used for Aircraft Simulation  FUN3D developed out of NASA Langley, and LAVA developed out of NASA Ames.  The proposed approach would be valid for both codes but would be explored with this TTT effort first using FUN3D.  The approach is to use volumetric source terms as well as the physical blockage to represent the impact of the propulsor (fan, Open Fan, or Propellor) rotor on the steady and stationary flowfield (the rotor effects are smeared out).  The physical blockage is known from the thickness distributions of the blades and their stagger angle.  The source terms would first come from current unsteady solutions and then from first-principal models that have been developed by others and can be improved by propulsion experts, AI (trained from unsteady simulations), and using test data.      Currently, FUN3D has an excellent actuator model  1  shown in Fig 2.  It allows for circumferential variations in flow quantities and is adjoint capable.  The method uses a low-speed blade element theory and does not account for the propulsor blockage.  LAVA has actuator disk capability, a volumetric source term capability but without blockage, and without production adjoint capability.           Figure 2.  Actuator Disk capability in FUN3D shown for PEGASUS concept  1 .       Rod Chima retired from NASA and had added a source term and blockage capability to his turbomachinery code, SWIFT  2 .  This code is structured multi-block, is not in active use at NASA, and was not applied to aircraft.  It was used for turbomachinery only.       The volume sources with blockage terms are outlined in a paper by Xie and Uranga  3  and the equations below come from this paper.  This method builds on work by David Hall in his MIT PhD work but added the blockage terms.  The blockage term, b, represents the blade thickness in the circumferential direction,          , and by the number of blades, B, and is defined by       and the equations of motion have the added source terms f in the momentum and energy equation       These equations are implicit in the code, APNASA, but those terms come a different model.        For this proposal, the source terms will come first from averaging (in time) the time dependent solution of an undistorted propulsor and a distorted propulsor.  The distorted propulsor will be the BLI2DTF case  4,5  that has been run experimentally and for which a Turbo  6  has been used coupled with LAVA.  Following that, the source terms will come from the models outlined in references  2,3 .  Turbo will be used to demonstrate the source terms and to implement the blockage terms since it is a simpler code than FUN3D and is used extensively for Turbomachinery simulations at NASA.      Another key aspect is that T-Blade3  7 , a turbomachinery geometry generator, will be used to define the geometry of the propulsor including the camber line, thickness and then the entire 3D turbomachinery blade.  It has been effectively used at NASA and for NASA applications since 2015. It is parametric and fully differentiated so applicable for eventual adjoint-enabled optimization.      Describe the anticipated milestones    The following work tasks are proposed.  Each task completion would be a low or higher level milestone.   Add blockage terms to Turbo by GRC Aeromechanics group   demonstration using TURBO for BLI2DTS case.  The source terms come from very careful averaging of the unsteady simulation   demonstration using TURBO with Spacefan  with and without blockage terms   Model source terms in TURBO with basic loss model and knowing geometry and rpm   use source terms (without blockage terms) with Fun3D for spacefan and compare to Turbo without blockage terms   Define the changes needed in FUN3D for blockage terms   Define geometry integration with T-Blade3 and Fun3D with loss and turning model   Outline 2nd year efforts   Each of these tasks would be done to demonstrate capability and not be done with the most rigor necessary for complete understanding.  Tasks 1 will require modifications of the TURBO source code as well as adding the source terms to Turbo.  Source terms input into FUN3D would require a small change of source code in FUN3D.       The Spacefan case is a convenient low-speed ventilation fan designed for the ISS.        Next Steps   The following tasks would be necessary after the first year    Add blockage terms to the equations of motion in FUN3D.   Demonstrate a low speed wing with a propeller with source terms   Use adjoint to modify the wing spanwise with effect of propeller   Choose a test case such as TTBW with OpenFan to demonstrate full capability.   Alternative approaches?    Since many of the steps have already been done in other contexts, the biggest risk to this approach is the aggressiveness of the schedule.  It would be focused more after a detailed assessment is done for each of the tasks.   References    Ordaz, Irian, Li Wang and Eric J.

RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW Title  Technical and economic trade study on using Photo-and-Photovoltaic-Batteries in Tandem with conventional or novel LH2 for long-haul (inter-continental) flights. 1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?

Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate. Green aviation faces multiple challenges (technical, processing, resources, and economic). To realize this vision, the aviation industry needs to solve various parts (energy storage, propulsion, supply chain, recyclability, and safety) of the puzzle. Short-haul flights could be solved using battery technology alone, it is unlikely that long-haul or intercontinental flights would be able to run on battery technology in the foreseeable future. There are a few alternative ideas proposed in the literature such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen propulsion, fuel cells, and hybrid electric vehicles, however, each of these faces its own technical, economic, and climate challenges. Any hybrid solution will require a separate battery to store energy, in addition to any backup or auxiliary systems. In such cases, the battery will occupy precious volume and mass in an aircraft. In addition, these batteries will need to be quickly recharged at an airport since other fuels require less turnaround time. This leads to two possible solutions, either fast charging at the destination or charging during the cruise portion of the flight (which is also the low-power portion of the flight). One possible solution is a photon or a photovoltaic battery, such a combined solution could reduce weight, use amble solar energy above the cloud cover, and charge the battery during flight. Note that NASA has envisioned solar cell-driven aircraft with Helios and Pathfinder in the past, but these efforts were limited to unmanned aircraft. Thus, some of the techniques and technologies can be leveraged. One of the major shortcomings of a solar cell (apart from low efficiency) is that it must be connected to a battery or other energy storage device, or a micro-grid to store distribute the electricity it generates. For this project, we propose a high-level techno-eco-sustainability study to investigate the potential benefit of combining energy storage and photovoltaics into a single integrated solution. However, a combination of these technologies is in a nascent stage with some explored integration ideas  1 , choosing a photosensitive material as an electrode or putting a PV or a battery as an integrated package (Fig. 1), for combining photovoltaics with batteries. One of the challenges is that the efficiency of a combined system is about 10 , significantly lower than a single junction (about 20   2 ), as well as current state-of-the-art multi-junction devices (the maximum efficiency is greater than 45 ). Another approach that is being developed is to use persistent phosphor for ""Photon Energy-Storage"". Here the photon energy is thermal energy, which can be converted through an electrochemical or a photovoltaic route. Figure 1  Different photo-charging techniques  a) closed system, b) integrated solution. The research in developing a technology can be significant and it is often necessary to develop trade-offs to venture into a new technology that is still nascent. Here we propose to perform a techno-economicenvironmental impact to understand the practicality of pursuing improving either technology while, performing the life-cycle-assessment of materials used in the technology and its environmental impact during the materials life-process (extraction, processing, reuse capability). Developing a trade study from a material, technology, recyclable, integration, supply chain, and greenness in addition to the viability of a novel technology can provide a good decision tool for new technologies. For this study, we will investigate the viability of photon-thermal electrochemical energy conversion and storage for electric aviation. a) b) The work will focus on three aspects  1) Safety, a combination of volatile electrolytes, and low melting point materials with photovoltaics could generate heat that could be catastrophic. A simple thermal analysis will be performed to identify safety risks  2) techno-economic-recyclability, using the Circular Economy Modeling and Analysis tool  3  from NREL will be used to perform technical, economic, and recyclability of technology and supply chains. Lastly, Environmental Sustainability  A comparative LCA with a cradle-to-gate approach will be performed using NREL s GREET (The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies Model) software  4 . The platform evaluates the material and energy flows for battery and photovoltaic materials from raw material extraction to device production. 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. The study is divided into 3 parts and will have 3 milestones  1) weight benefits should exceed 20 , while safety should be similar or better than a hybrid system  2) techno-economic-recyclability, material availability and recyclability should be like the hybrid system  3) LCA analysis should reveal the complete life-cycle reduces carbon emissions (or carbon costs) similar to the hybrid system. 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? If the trade-study reveals that either photon or a photo battery is beneficial to either hybrid-aircraft or future electric aviation focused airports, then the next step would be to work on identifying technology bottlenecks and solving them from a material or performance perspective. For (hypothetical) example, if photo battery was found viable for hybrid-aircraft, next step would be to focus on improving energy conversion efficiency, changing material to provide higher voltages, or charging rate of these photobatteries. Since this is a trade study, if viable it would also allow us to focus on infrastructural, material processing, device optimization, system optimization, or improving material efficiency. 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? It is unlikely that a trade-study reveals nothing, since by nature the goal of it is to identify feasibility on various fronts. But if the project s outcome is that either photon or a photo battery is beneficial, the next step would be to focus on the technological challenge for the rest of the year. However, if it was found that neither of them would be reasonable either from an economic or safety perspective, then depending on the barrier, if it is the battery coupling, then solar cell could be explored for generating O2 and H2 for a fuel cell. However, if solar cell is found limiting, then the framework for feasibility study environmental friendly cradle-to-grave analysis for materials and process for batteries and fuelcells are developed which could be used to apply to other challenging studies.

We are in a race to develop solutions that maintain and improve quality of life without intensifying causes of climate change.  The development of electrified aircraft allows humanity to maintain civilization with less carbon emissions. One challenge to electrification of aircraft is the mass of batteries required to sustain flight significantly limits the aircraft payload and flight duration.  We propose the inclusion of high voltage, thin film, perovskite based solar arrays laminated onto the aircraft wings and fuselage in production. The integration of these solar cells offset power density needs for batteries for electrified aircraft reducing weight. When coupled with a fuselage manufactured from light weight next generation materials.       Outfitting an electric airplane with perovskite solar cells would offset power density needs for the Lithium ion batteries, reducing weight.  If we assume a 737 airplane traveling from NYC to LA on a sunny day, with modest 20  efficient perovskite solar cells integrated, the solar cells would generate 320 kWhr of energy on that flight. This is achieved with just 1.2 kg of perovskite solar cells total mass over the plane. That energy allows a mass reduction of 1200 kg of lithium ion batteries. These ultralight weight solar cells save 1200 kg of battery mass. Perovskites are especially propitious for photovoltaic application due to their exceptional properties, such as large-charge carrier diffusion lengths  1 , long carrier lifetimes, strong optical absorption  2 , weak exciton binding  3 , and favorable band gaps  2 . Perovskite based photovoltaics are thin films (300-500 nm) light weight, low cost, and are compatible with solution or vapor phase processing techniques. Multi-junction (tandem) solar cells consisting of multiple light absorbers with considerably different bandgaps show great potential in breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of a single junction solar cell (33 ) by absorbing light in a broader range of wavelengths. 4  These tandem solar cells are expected to achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 25.2  (with theoretical limits of 42 ) and are 500X thinner than the current state of the art (SOA) technology.  Perovskite solar cells also absorb light more strongly than SOA GaAs solar cells.      My previous research has led to the development of single junction perovskite solar cell at reproducible 20  power conversion efficiency that can withstand the harsh low earth environment and are stable to terrestrial stressors. We can apply lessons learned from that effort to develop a lightweight low-cost perovskite based tandem photovoltaic capable of greater power output. We will select materials suitable for the wide bandgap (1.7-1.9 eV) second junction solar cell and we will demonstrate the ability to fabricate these cells, regardless of solvent compatibility, with a lamination technique that has been demonstrated to be effective with perovskite interlayers. 5        Electrified aircraft is a newer venture with the first passenger electric aircraft, Alice, flight in September 2022.  Long duration unmanned air vehicles augmented with photovoltaics like the AeroVironment Helios vehicle have demonstrated feasibility of solar and fuel cell powered aerial vehicles.  These vehicles have currently been limited to small payload vehicles as mass is limited.  Emerging photovoltaic technologies, like those based on perovskites, allow for previously unachievable specific powers (W kg).  When compared to the state of the art III-V or Silicon solar cells, perovskites       Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.

This work should be evaluated on the delivery of materials identified and selected for the second junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cell.

The proposed tandem device efficiency, manufacturability, and durability should be considered.    After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    The next steps of this research should include deposition of the champion wide bandgap perovskite active layer for the second junction. We will then use the lamination technique to combine the first and second junction of the devices to yield a tandem perovskite based photovoltaic. We will perform local optimization to increase the power conversion efficiency and test the cell in relevant environmental stressors including humidity and thermal stresses.   This work has applications in both the terrestrial and space markets. Potential transition to TACP or GCD can facilitate further technical development and advancement of technology readiness level.  There are also many small businesses and universities in this area so SBIR STTR opportunities could facilitate tech transfer and commercialization.

Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    If, three months into this work, I discovered that our lamination technique was not feasible for the materials I selected, I would first revisit where in the stack I was laminating. There may be a different material layer more suited to undergo this process.  If that did not resolve the technical challenges I would revisit materials selection, guided by literature, and alter my deposition technique either to omit the need for lamination or to ensure compatibility. We will use a combination of the literature, evidence-based decision making, computational modeling, and experimental materials development to design a wide bandgap perovskite photovoltaic that will supplement the absorption of existing perovskite solar cell providing a path toward energy augmentation for electrified aircraft.        1  L.

Hydrogen Powered Aviation Through Sustainable Manufacturing and Repair of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic Composite Cryotanks.,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title  Hydrogen Powered Aviation Through Sustainable Manufacturing and Repair of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic Composite Cryotanks. 1. Provide a description of the work  The current use of fossil fuels within the aviation industry contributes more to global warming than is generally appreciated because of the mix of climate pollutants it generates. A recent model analyzed the CO2 and non-CO2 effects (like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation) to assess aviation's total warming footprint. The report found aviation contributed approximately 4  to observed human-induced global warming to date, despite being responsible for only 2.4  of global annual emissions of CO2.(1) One solution to the continued impact of aviation on climate change is a shift toward Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), such as hydrogen. The European Clean Aviation Initiative reports that hydrogen power can be part of the green aviation solution in that hydrogen power completely eliminates CO2 emissions and can be produced carbon-free. Considering non-CO2 emissions as well, the latest estimates show that hydrogen combustion could reduce the climate impact of flight by up to 75 , and fuel-cell propulsion by up to 90 .(2) The Clean Sky 2 Program, which is part of the Clean Aviation Initiative found that hydrogen either for fuel cells, direct burn in gas turbine engines or as a building block for synthetic liquid fuels could feasibly power aircraft with entry into service by 2035 for shortrange aircraft at a cost of less than  20 extra per person on a short-range flight, and reducing climate impact by 50 to 90 . (3) Problem  While a clear pay-off exists for hydrogen powered aircraft, the physical space required to carry gaseous hydrogen is large, requiring cryogenic storage hydrogen fuel as a liquid, at -253oC. The successful utilization of lightweight carbon fiber polymer composite tanks has met challenges cycling to this temperature, the primary challenge being microcracking of the matrix. Has someone tried to solve the problem before. Composite cryotanks have been evaluated by industry and Government for decades.(4) The most common materials and manufacturing approach for composite tanks has been autoclave consolidated carbon fiber and epoxy composite. As the tank is subjected to repeated fill drain cycles, the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the carbon fiber reinforcement and epoxy matrix leads to residual stresses in the laminated tank wall resulting in matrix microcracking (5). This was addressed by the NASA Composite Cryotank Technology Demonstration Project in 2013 by using thin plies to reduce interlaminar stresses. This approach was successful in reducing, but not eliminating microcracking. Once microcracking starts, it cannot be repaired in an epoxy matrix cryotank. In addition, the epoxy matrix material is cured in an autoclave which is a high energy process and requires the use of non-recyclable  non-reusable consumable materials. A separate materials option for composite cryotanks is carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics. Thermoplastic matrix composites offer greater compliance than the traditional epoxy (thermoset) matrix materials and therefore the potential to reduce matrix microcracking. There has been limited research using thermoplastics due to manufacturing challenges such as low drapability of the composite prepreg and the requirement for high processing temperatures. Recent developments in low melt temperature materials and automated manufacturing provide new opportunities for this material class. Thermoplastic composites are receiving attention for cryogen storage, most notably a study is currently underway in the Netherlands to build and evaluate thermoset and thermoplastics composites for liquid hydrogen cryotanks for commercial aircraft. (6) Where did they go wrong what is different about this approach  We propose to focus on thermoplastics, and pushing a step further than the European study we propose to experimentally and analytically evaluate thermoplastic composites for (a) viability as a composite cryo-tank material for hydrogen, (b) repairability of microcracking within the matrix to increase the lifetime and reduce waste and (c) reduce the cost and environmental impact of manufacturing relative to the state-of-the-art autoclave consolidation through use of thermoplastic welding options, such as ultrasonic welding. If successful the proposed work will enable hydrogen-based propulsion opportunities within the aviation industry, energy savings in manufacturing, and increased safety through repairability of the thermoplastic tank. 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. The key performance requirement for a composite cryo-tank is that it holds cryogenic liquid. Microcracking has been identified as the primary path for cryogen loss through the tank wall, therefore the feasibility of microcrack mitigation and repair will be the focus of this initial effort. a. State-of-the-Art (SOA) assessment and partner identification. The past 3-5 years have seen a resurgence of U.S. based research with thermoplastic matrix composites leading to rapid advances in manufacturing and materials testing. i. A SOA assessment will be used to establish baseline metrics for consolidation quality for composites manufactured out of the autoclave and repaired composites. ii. A partner will be identified for ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites. NASA GRC has current contracts for thermoplastic welding with Agile Ultrasonics in Columbus Ohio. This is for flat coupon welds, (as opposed to a tank) iii. Feasibility assessment will be performed to  trade  thermoset and thermoplastic composite materials through analysis. Existing database properties will be used. b. Assess feasibility of sustainable (out-of-autoclave) manufacturing  build upon NASA s recent experience with thermoplastic welding to demonstrate out-of autoclave consolidation of flat panels and plates. i. Establish industry partnership for out-of-autoclave manufacturing via ultrasonic welding methods. - Manufacture flat panels to generate test coupons for compression strength and interlaminar shear strength. - Manufacture cylindrical components to demonstrate manufacturing at the subcomponent level. - Finite element analysis to for failure prediction. - Evaluate consolidation quality through standard inspection techniques and baseline mechanical tests. ii. Establish in-house capability for ultrasonic welding. - Manufacture flat panels to generate compression and interlaminar shear strength test coupons for comparison to industry fabricated parts. - Manufacture cylindrical components to demonstrate manufacturing at the subcomponent level. - Evaluate consolidation quality through standard inspection techniques and baseline mechanical tests. - Data comparison between in-house and industry manufactured parts will be used to inform in-house process development. c. Assess feasibility of microcrack repair  utilize established welding techniques to re-melt heal microcracks in the composite matrix. i. Induce microcracking in the thermoplastic composite through cycling to cryogenic temperature. ii. Repair the cracks through ultrasonic welding methods. iii. Mechanical testing of repaired coupons for comparison to pristine d. Budget  Costs for this project are associated with materials, manufacturing, and test. This includes a contract for ultrasonic welding (out of autoclave consolidation) while concurrently building the capability in-house. 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? This work will establish feasibility of the material class to enable sustainable aviation through reduced energy manufacturing and a transition to hydrogen fuel. Next steps include but are not limited to the following. a. Establish a team with expertise in the requirements of hydrogen powered aviation to define requirements of the composite tank and support structure. b. Establish a team to design the tank and support structure including connections, fittings, baffles slosh mitigation, fuel lines, etc. c. Establish a design and analysis team to ensure margins of safety are met for the cryo-tank. d. Develop analysis tools to predict microcracking based on micromechanics models. e. Follow the building block approach to manufacture and test from the coupon to the component level. Potential area of transition includes the Commercially Viable Hydrogen Aircraft for Reduction of Greenhouse Emissions Project. 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? a. For this effort there are multiple paths to address this scenarioi. We have proposed two technology developments, lightweight composite tank, and energy savings through out of autoclave manufacturing. The energy savings in manufacturing is the higher risk component of this proposal due to challenges in meeting the consolidation quality achieved in an autoclave. If deemed technically infeasible we can focus on the composite tank in a traditional manufacturing environment. ii. Second option would be to shift the focus away from tanks and move to more energy efficient manufacturing for aircraft structures. This is work we had started through CIF funding and can continue.

Robust Repair and Refurbishment Technologies Enabling Reusability and Life Extension of Ceramic Matrix Composites Propulsion Components,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   Title   Robust Repair and Refurbishment Technologies Enabling Reusability and Life Extension of Ceramic Matrix Composites Propulsion Components    Advanced silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC SiC) composite components are currently in service and being further developed for insertion in several turbine engine applications. The advantages of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) over metals include lower weight, higher temperature capability and stability, and corrosion resistance while the advantages over monolithic (non-fiber reinforced) ceramics include damage tolerance, graceful failure, and thermal shock resistance. CMC turbine engine components offer significant performance benefits of reduced cooling, fuel burn, and emissions (NOx and COx), however, the materials are relatively expensive with complex manufacturing required for the integrated constituents of the CMC. During service, the CMC components (e.g. turbine blades, vanes, shrouds, and combustor liners) experience degradation in performance due to various forms of damage including oxidation, impact damage, erosion, surface spallation, and delamination. Currently, as CMC parts wear out and, in some cases, when cooling channels within CMCs are degraded or clogged, they need to be replaced with brand new parts. The continuous replacement of CMC components will be quite expensive given the high acquisition cost of components. It will also contribute to material waste and a higher demand for labor, time, and energy resources during their fabrication compared to that of refurbished parts.    Currently, metallic turbine engine components are regularly repaired and refurbished during engine overhauls to extend life of components. This repair and refurbishment provide significant cost savings, extends reliability, safety, and life of components as well as reduce wastes. However, looking at the ceramic matrix composite landscape, no viable repair or refurbishment technology is available. At GRC, we have significant experience in developing repair and refurbishment technologies for space shuttle leading edges (C C composites) and a collaborative program with Goodrich Corp. for the C C composite aircraft brake repair and refurbishment.  These technologies were developed at high TRL level and wide variety of testing was conducted.    We propose to advance the state-of-the-art by developing methods to repair and refurbish SiC SiC CMCs to retain material performance requirements and extend their service life thus reducing waste. As of now, there are no suitable methods to extend the life of damaged CMCs using repair and refurbishment technologies. One method investigated by other researchers is the self-healing of cracked CMCs by forming glasses in the matrix or coating which melt and flow to fill in cracks (ref. 1-2). However, the formed glass can only slowdown the oxidation in the vicinity of a matrix crack without contributing to CMC mechanical load carrying capability. Also, low melting glasses are not appropriate as they create stress corrosion, vaporization, and reduce service life. Currently used CMCs do not have any glass forming constituents due to these reasons. Any repair and refurbishment technology should not only be able to repair only cracks but other forms of CMC damage such as cooling channels restoration. It should also avoid potential chemical incompatibility with the CMCs and or their environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). Furthermore, the self-healing crack methods have temperature capabilities well below the SiC SiC maximum service temperature of 2400 F and especially the new target of 2700 F for next generation SiC SiC. A group from Boeing has investigated patches for repairing space shuttle leading edges (ref. 3). Their approach does not seem to have been fully developed or reported. The leading-edge patches are not fully processed until earth-atmosphere-reentry heating where the high reentry temperatures act to pyrolyze the material. At NASA GRC, Dr. Mrityunjay Singh, who is part of this proposal, had developed  Glenn Refractory Adhesive for Bonding and Exterior Repair (GRABER) (refs. 4-8) , which was successfully used for repairing reinforced carbon carbon composite (RCC) with different types of damage (cracks, spallation, delamination, etc). The verification and qualification testing was carried out in arc-jet testing facilities at NASA JSC, NASA Ames, and Boeing LCAT facilities in St. Louis, MO. He has also worked with largest US aircraft brake manufacturer for the repair and refurbishment of C C composite aircraft brakes. Experience gained from the assessment of CMC damage and repair techniques will be leveraged for our specific case of SiC SiC CMCs for turbine engine applications with an emphasis on retaining mechanical properties and environmental stability in a steam environment. Engine combustion environments are rich in water vapor which can cause reactions and surface recession and degradation of SiC SiC materials.    The approach is to develop a method for the repair and refurbishment of SiC SiC CMCs. Material compositions will be developed and evaluated. Processing conditions will be optimized. Various types of flaws (e.g. surface, through holes, and de-laminations) will be introduced into the CMC test specimens. For larger flaws, a preform of SiC woven cloth will be integrated with the repair materials for maintaining CMC structural integrity. The ability for the repair and patch methods to retain mechanical strength and environmental durability will be assessed. Testing of tensile coupons while under a mechanical stress in a steam environment will be conducted to compare the performance of undamaged, damaged   unrepaired, and damaged   repaired CMCs. The results will be analyzed to determine repair effectiveness. Correlations will be made between material microstructures, processing conditions, and properties.    CMC materials and lab equipment are available for the activity. Mechanical testing will be conducted in load frames with the ability to test in various environments such as oxidizing and steam. Strain will be monitored by high temperature extensometers and digital image correlation. Damage will be monitored and assessed using acoustic emission technique which will help determine conditions for inducing damage in samples prior to applying the repair technology. The well-equipped labs and relevant experience in ceramic processing, repair, mechanical testing, and environmental exposure provides a good chance for success, rapid progress, and requires no new capabilities.    CMCs enable more efficient turbine engines for reducing fuel consumption, carbon emissions and environmental impacts due to their higher operating temperatures, reduced cooling requirements, and improved engine efficiency. Successful repair methods will further enhance the green technology benefits of CMCs by contributing to their greater utilization in turbine engines, longer component lives, and reduced costs and waste.   Milestones   Identify relevant types of SiC SiC CMC damage, suitable repair materials, and processing approaches (12 2023).   Develop compositions and processing conditions for repair materials to be applied to damaged SiC SiC coupons (3 2024).    Develop a silicon carbide fiber reinforced patch repair method for larger flaws (6 2024).   Evaluate repaired and unrepaired composites under relevant mechanical stresses and environmental conditions (9 2024).     The work will be evaluated based on the ability to retain the mechanical properties and environmental durability in the repaired CMC compared to the performance of the unrepaired CMC. Success will be achieved if there is significant improvement in the usability of the repaired CMC. Monotonic tensile tests will be performed at room or high temperature on repaired and unrepaired CMCs to quantify the enhancement in strength provided by CMC repair technology. Additionally, stress rupture testing of repaired and non-repaired CMC test coupons in a steam rig under a constant or cyclic load until failure will be conducted. Next, the times to failure will be compared for as-fabricated, repaired, and non-repaired SiC SiC tensile specimens to identify the improvement in CMC life and reusability provided by the implemented CMC repair technology.   If the repair of SiC SiC activity is successful, the next steps are to further increase the technology readiness level (TRL). Composite repair could be progressed toward an actual SiC SiC turbine engine component. Repair of a complex geometry could be addressed as well as integrating the reapplication or repair of an EBC coating. For patch repairs with woven SiC cloth, fiber coatings can be integrated for enhanced mechanical properties. Also, for repairs over CMC components with film cooling holes, the reintroduction of cooling holes can be demonstrated.    The CMC repair technology can be transferred to engine companies. Also, there are transition opportunities for ground-based power generation. There may be opportunities to collaborate with NASA aeronautics projects or engine companies which are testing or are already using CMC components. The repair of their tested and in-service parts could be demonstrated.    With our past experiences and lab capabilities, we stand a good chance of developing SiC SiC CMC repair technology and believe we have made a fair assessment of the feasibility. However, if the method was determined to be non-feasible, we could quickly pivot our activities. If there was an issue with material or processing compatibility, we could adjust our approach to be better matched with SiC SiC materials. If the whole approach is not feasible and needs to be abandoned, we would pursue another necessary and relevant technology for CMCs. During the remaining months, joining and integration technologies could be pursued which allow for the buildup of larger and more complex shaped CMC parts as well as their incorporation with metal-based systems (e.g. support structures, blade roots and hubs, cooling manifolds, etc.). Our team has extensive experience in developing joining and integration technologies which can be leveraged here. Each joining approach must be tailored for its specific case based on material pairings (e.g. CMC to CMC or CMC to metal), joining interlayer approach (e.g. paste, foil, hybrid, and multi-layer), joining method (e.g. brazing, diffusion bonding, eutectic phase bonding, reactive slurry infiltration), part geometries, applications conditions (e.g. operating environment, temperature, and stress) and performance requirements. A narrowed focus could be to demonstrate the feasibility of a brazing approach for the case of brazing a SiC SiC CMC blade root to a metallic rotor hub.    References   1.  Rebillat, F.

Performance Enhancement of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Components with Machine Learning for Electric Aircraft Propulsion,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   Title  Performance Enhancement of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Components with Machine Learning for Electric Aircraft Propulsion   Description of the work    NASA aeronautics goals include pioneering new technology to reduce emissions, noise, and carbon footprint from air travel.  The feasibility of using fuel cells and on-board cryogenic hydrogen (H2) systems in combination with electric motors for zero emission commercial transport aircraft has been widely examined.  Developing a practical, implementable carbon-free electric power system for a highly constrained  electric aircraft  application is a complex and complicated poly-dimensional optimization problem. The primary factor limiting fuel cell implementation remains thermal management at the required high fuel cell stack specific power levels resulting from inadequate heat transfer and unacceptably inefficient operation manifesting as low average cell voltage (Vcc). Despite many historical and current research efforts by government, academia, and aviation industry, the relative importance of design parameters across multiple systems and levels of assembly remains poorly understood.  Materials science and engineering has played a central role in the evolution of improved electrochemical technologies such as fuel cells and batteries. However, traditional   Edisonian   approaches to evolve from discovery to commercial implementation is too costly and time consuming relative to the accelerating anthropogenic climate change resulting from Carbon Cycle disruptions. The emergence of Machine Learning (ML) modeling methods with increasingly powerful computers has augmented cross-disciplinary technological advances from materials discovery to commercialized products.  This activity proposes using the latest artificial intelligence (AI) research to develop two ML models. the first model is critical to understand the relationships among system-level variables for electric aircraft propulsion (EAP) by assessing fuel cell power system response (Vcc) to the normalized aircraft electrical load current density (i) (          (          ,  ,                     ,       .)                              ,    ,                                 ,            .   ). The second model will implement a self-driven approach based on the first model and leverage existing models to elucidate the critical supporting parameters for optimizing the fuel cell system operation and calculate the EAP fuel cell power system performance metrics of power density (W L), specific power (W kg) and long-term stability (                        ) from repeated experimentation.  Establishing a self-driving laboratory for a ML fuel cell technology modeling tool marks a pioneering leap in sustainable energy research which sets it apart from traditional modeling methodologies like Monte Carlo modeling. This information will focus objective development goals by identifying material, components and or system interfaces that can viably meet EAP performance metrics and provide feasible performance profiles for aircraft-level models investigating EAP. These sensitive parameters potentially can range from fuel cell component materials, mechanisms to enhance convective heat transfer, to low mass phase change materials, to optimizing power management and distribution (PMAD) components for reducing ohmic resistance. The study is a general development of a tool of FC for implementing EAP in the medium-scale commercial aircraft as it provides the most impactful transformation to zero emission commercial aviation.

Jensen, J.O., 2016, Springer International Pub., Switzerland   Anticipated milestones and Performance Metrics   Figure 1 illustrates the proposed iterative project workflow required to develop and train the ML model within the self-driving laboratory and conduct the statistical data evaluation for producing feasible and actionable data products of system sensitivity parameters influencing cell voltage response (Vcc) to the power demanded by the aircraft when assessed in electrical current density (i in mA cm2). The five-(5) project milestones are shown in a GANTT chart in Figure 2.   Figure 1  Schematic of Project Work Plan   The work starts with collecting relevant PEM FC performance data, especially those for vehicle and aircraft propulsion, to develop the ML training data sets. Where the statistical evaluation determines that data gaps exist, synthetic data will be generated based on first-principal models. In parallel, the first ML tool element will develop a precise machine learning model that can predict the voltage response of the fuel cell system to the vehicle electrical load demand. Through preliminary statistical work, model building, and feature engineering, this first element will provide valuable insights into system variables and the relative relationship among these variables. While Monte Carlo models are valuable for probabilistic analysis and estimating outcomes within well-defined distributions, self-driving AI ML labs offer a superior approach. The most influential ML tool element will drive NASA software in a self-driven lab for closing any gaps between the fuel cell system performance metrics and aircraft performance requirements. These labs are equipped to autonomously conduct experiments, adapt to changing conditions, and continuously learn from data. By harnessing machine learning and AI, they minimize the potential for errors and inefficiencies associated with human intervention. This innovative approach aligns with the vision of Industry 4.0, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies reshapes manufacturing and research processes (Abolhasani et al., 2019). Furthermore, the self-driving lab seamlessly integrates with our software to drive tools toward achievable desired outputs. This symbiotic relationship enhances fuel cell performance, ultimately advancing the frontiers of sustainable energy research and development. Any deficiencies in the resulting specific power, power density, and performance stability then guide development objectives to improve FC power and propulsion system performance.    This effort will produce six-(6) deliverables  a preliminary EAP requirements set, a ML modeling tool consisting of two elements, a preliminary PEM fuel cell model performance set, Data Gap Closure Resource Estimate, a ML model Validation Resource Estimate, and a final report.           Figure 2  Project GANTT Chart   Follow-on Activities   The products of this foundational work would be integrated into existing aircraft-level models for developing electric aircraft and accelerate the development of the FC power and propulsion systems. Learning more about the relationships between system variables (features or input) will focus future research on the technologies limiting this application. In the next phase of this work, a significant experimental data collection is anticipated in order to replace the synthetic data by empirical data to validate and improve the ML model fidelity. Should these products become sufficiently mature, it remains feasible to incorporated them into an eventual Digital Twin model architecture.    PI Scenario   This scenario does not apply to this process as ML modeling is inherently an iterative process that utilizes the  fail early, fail often, but always fail forward  (J.C. Maxwell) approach. The ML model matures with each iteration and provides valuable insights into the poly-dimensional space under investigation. There exist multiple tools that can be used should one fail and there exists a great deal of data to mine that could be temporarily supported by synthetic data until credible empirical data became available. Implementing FC power and propulsion systems in a carbon-free electric aircraft includes many challenges available for ML modeling. There are many components, sub-systems, and interfaces that require additional performance data and development prior to integrating into an electric aircraft. Should resources become available, conducting experiments to close any identified data gaps would improve data quality.  ",,,,,,
Maximizing the Efficiency of Advanced Air Mobility with Formation Flight,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Maximizing the Efficiency of Advanced Air Mobility with Formation Flight   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.       Formation flying is a well-known approach for improving the efficiency of flight. Migratory birds flying in V-formation gain significant efficiency by taking advantage of the upwash from the wing tip of the leading bird, which allows the trailing birds to fly with reduced angle-of-attack and lower induced drag  1 . For birds and aircraft alike, the key to gaining maximum efficiency with this technique is identifying the optimal configuration of the formation. While birds can do this adaptively in actual flight (and millions of years of evolution), computational tools are needed to investigate the possible benefits for safely improving the efficiency of human air transportation especially for use of newly emerging electric-Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle designs.   The computational objectives needed for a comprehensive study of formation flight are    Finding the optimal formation configuration as function of vehicle types design and flight conditions,   Identifying the most efficient (and safe) way to form the configuration,   and maneuver within the formation, e.g., to transfer the lead-aircraft   potentially with specialized actuators for control within the wake where traditional actuators (e.g., ailerons) lose effectiveness.   A study of the control laws to   automatically hold the optimal configuration,   while remaining robust to adverse weather disturbances,   Determining methods to maneuver the overall formation as one,    and compute optimal trajectories of the formation in weather.      The concept of formation flight is not new and has been studied extensively. Some theoretical studies have shown potential drag reduction for extended formation flight at 38 -45 , and flight tests with more conventional vehicle types (F A 18 and C-17) at AFRC have shown fuel flow reduction of 7 -18   2 .  Flight dynamics in wake is not necessarily LTI (linear time invariant) but is nonlinear LTV (linear time varying)  3 .  The efficiency gains from free lift associated with formation flight may be offset by degradation in stability and control.  Safety and ride quality are important considerations.  The uncertainty around the trade-space for eVTOL vehicles is exactly why this type of work needs to be funded initially at a small funding level.  Because of the nature of the challenges in many different areas (nonlinear aerodynamics, nonlinear LTV flight dynamics, and nonlinear control), this is a rich area for research.  There are computational models for wake interaction currently under development  4  which could be utilized in this study to enable rapid assessment and trade-space exploration.      There are however few (if any) studies on optimization of formation flight for more efficient Urban Air Mobility operations with eVTOL vehicles. Also, the simultaneous considerations of control robustness and formation safety are missing from all the studies that we know of. Traditionally, flight safety is concerned with wake avoidance, whereas the objective here is to leverage it for energy savings.        1  J. C. Chan, P. C. Wang, and H. Hesse.

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   In the seedling effort, a sandbox demonstration case will be developed for a formation of three UAM Lift Cruise reference design vehicles (already available from collaborative work with the RVLT project). The problem will be analyzed computationally to determine optimal vehicle configuration (distance and orientation of vehicles to each-other) in a cruise flight-condition for maximum range given a total energy constraint. Initial models for the formation in the cruise condition (with additional states for aerodynamic interactions) will be developed and analyzed from a robust control perspective to gauge the feasibility for safe operations with adverse weather (simulated using a gust and Dryden turbulence models). The final results are intended to inform the creation of new formation flight-based sustainability technical challenges within TTT.   Schematic of the NASA Lift Cruise reference vehicle concept ...   Figure 1  RVLT Lift Cruise Concept Design   After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    Analyzing the overall safety of formation flight and, especially, convincing the FAA, will be the most difficult part. Further investigation will be required into vehicle technologies for detecting failures in advance and the ability to break formation safely when adverse events occur. Developing the computational technology (and leveraging existing solutions) required to address all of the aforementioned objectives could form the basis for a new technical challenge within the TTT project, one that simultaneously explores the aerodynamics, vehicle design, and robust fault-tolerant control required to realize the full benefit of formation flight for sustainable aviation.      Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    If initial results show insufficient benefit, pivoting to consideration of vehicle design for increasing the benefit of formation flight is a possibility. This might include the design of wing-tip modifications, use of variable camber flaps, or even the optimized design of a specialized unmanned lead vehicle that allows passenger carrying vehicles to fly behind it with maximized efficiency.

Sensor System Study for Health Management of Sustainable Aviation Based on Electric Propulsion,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL Title  Sensor System Study for Health Management of Sustainable Aviation Based on Electric Propulsion 1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Problem  NASA is committed to supporting the U.S. climate goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector by 2050 and is leading federal agencies and industry to accelerate the development of sustainable aviation technologies. This includes developing and deploying alternate, new vehicle designs and architectures including Hybrid Electric or All Electric vehicle concepts  1,2 . Examples are the Subsonic Single Aft Engine (SUSAN) Electrofan, the Singleaisle Turboelectric AiRCraft with Aft Boundary Layer propulsor (STARC-ABL), and other activities  3,4,5 . However, these aircraft concepts introduce new hardware systems along with new health management challenges. For example, fault detection and diagnostics of hybrid electric or all electric propulsion systems requires an understanding of the operation, performance, degradation, and failure mechanisms of electric machines, converters (inverters rectifiers), and power cables along with the operation of these devices in increasingly complex flight environments  6 . Introduction of new vehicle types and integrated power and propulsion systems requires increasingly intelligent vehicle systems with capability to detect, diagnose, and predict system degradation, faults, and failures in a resilient and trustworthy manner. Furthermore, intelligent vehicle systems must be capable of estimating system capability as it degrades. Monitoring the system health state has an impact on system operating cost, performance, efficiency, and environmental impact. Predictive maintenance reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time through reduced unnecessary maintenance costs and improved vehicle availability and throughput. Efforts are ongoing to evaluate and document potential failure modes and hazards posed by an Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) system  6 . Due to their increased complexity and integrated nature, EAP systems present additional failure modes and hazards not found in conventional aircraft propulsion designs. Mitigation of these EAP failures requires a system-level design and analysis approach, which is on-going. Major findings of this work include that EAP degradation, faults, and failure modes present new health management challenges. This requires background understanding of electrical engineering and system control and concept of operations (motor control, generator control, battery management systems). Furthermore, electrical systems don t always degrade fail gracefully, which makes early (timely) diagnosis to enable maintenance challenging. Faults include those associated with  electric machines (motors generators) such as the health of bearings, lubrication and cooling, windings, rotor, insulation  converters (inverters rectifiers), electronic components and the cooling system  high voltage wire and cables, including short or open circuits and insulation breakdown  overall power quality including degradation faults leading to voltage ripple and power instabilities  and thermal management system and battery failures (thermal runaway). These types of faults require new sensor measurement types compared to turbine engine, e.g., concentrating on current and voltage, and tailored for a new infrastructure associated with EAP rather than turbine engines. Although these faults are being identified in  System Analysis and Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FEMCA) studies presently ongoing in the ARMD  7 , there is limited ongoing work related to understanding the sensor types and sensing approaches most optimized for this new aircraft infrastructure. Such an understanding is a necessary first step toward Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM), combining sensing, diagnostics, and prognostics, for future Sustainable Aviation based on EAP. Objectives  This task will work in parallel with the ongoing analysis of EAP fault detection  6,7  to examine sensors and sensor systems that can address fault detection in EAP aircraft. The challenges for sensor technology for EAP applications include  operation in a high noise environment or with corona discharge at altitude  increasing integration of sensor technology into electric components to minimize size weight power and cost  multi parameter measurements to better understand the health state of the EAP system  providing actionable information for higher level diagnostics  and leveraging the EAP architecture itself to provide better system level diagnostics. This task intends to formulate a framework for sensor and sensors systems for EAP health management applications addressing these challenges. Approach  In particular, this task will examine the EAP architecture and fault studies to first understand the wide range of potential failure mechanisms. It will then survey the existing methods of EAP fault detection to both understand how it is done now, and shortfalls to these approaches. It will then examine methods for improved EAP sensing including, e.g., new sensor types or additive manufacturing. The conclusion of this work is a white paper summarizing the above activities and a preliminary road map for possible ARMD future investment in this area. This task leverages the ongoing activities in the Intelligent Control and Autonomy Branch (LCC) and related existing expertise and capabilities  7 . Coordination between multiple sensor Subject Matter Experts (SME) within the Communications and Intelligent Systems Division, as well as SME in other Branches both at NASA Glenn Research Center and across the agency is planned. At least one trip is planned given available resources to a relevant conference related to this topic and or industry to broaden the input provided to this study. Although not presently proposed, but could considered with project management, is the possibility of hosting a Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) on the topic Sensor Technology for EAP Health Management, or even more broadly for IVHM for Sustainable EAP Aviation. Anticipated Benefits  This task performs the initial survey work needed to define a sensor approach to be combined with both on-going and future ARMD activities in IVHM for EAP applications program in sensing, diagnostics, and prognostics. IVHM for EAP is necessary for eventual system application, whether it be for safety, economic, efficiency, or performance reasons. Overall, new electric vehicles can be smarter, safer, and more efficient leveraging the difference in architecture  this work is a first step in providing sensor technology to enable this vision. 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. Milestone Date Project Initiation 11 6 23 Documentation of EAP Identified Fault Mechanisms (On-going Project) 12 6 23 Survey of Present EAP Fault Detection Approaches 3 30 24 Evaluation of Potential Alternate EAP Sensor Architectures 7 30 24 Summary Whitepaper and Draft Roadmap for EAP Sensor Development 9 1 24 This project should be evaluated upon whether a core understanding of the challenges of sensor detection in EAP systems has been clearly articulated, and potential approaches for future work coupling both sensors and diagnostics for EAP sustainable aviation have been reasonably identified for future program implementation potentially in FY25. It is also expected that coordination with other organizations related to, e.g., structural diagnostics or sustainable aviation prognostics, will be ongoing. 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? The need for IVHM for Sustainable Aviation has been introduced to ARMD project management with positive response. In particular, it is our understanding that TTT Management has acknowledged the importance of this area and expressed interest for potential future funding. Assuming no project funding in FY24, this proposed project matures an understanding of the field and establishes a framework for a more expansive IVHM development in FY 25 if chosen by project management. 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? Sensor development for health management of EAP systems is one component of what is necessary for possible sustainable aviation. An equally challenging area is health management for hydrogen powered vehicles especially those using cryogenic hydrogen. A NASA workshop identified a wide range of challenges associated with converting from conventional hydrocarbon fuel systems to hydrogen-based systems  8 . These include a significant range of safety concerns associated with hydrogen leakage, seals degradation, or structural embrittlement. If a change of direction is decided related to defining sensor technology for EAP applications, transition of the task to another aspect of sustainable aviation, hydrogen powered vehicles, would also have a significant impact on understanding the potential of IVHM for sustainable aviation.

Additive Manufacturing of Polyimde Composites for Battery Packaging,TTT Green Aviation,,"Additive Manufacturing of Polyimde Composites for Battery Packaging   Introduction    Advances in lithium battery has made electrical propulsion a reality in the electrified aircrafts. Lightweight aluminum has been used preferentially chosen as the packaging material due to the large amount of power require to propel the electrified aircrafts.  the weight saving in engines often translates into 3 times of weight saving in the aircrafts, it is imperative to find alternative materials for battery packs other than aluminum. Additive manufacturing of lightweight, high temperature thermoset polyimide matrix composites (PMC) in place of aluminum casing for battery packaging will save 50  weight (Al PMC density ratio   2.7 1.3 g cc), ease the manufacturing process of complex shape and improve production efficiency. Furthermore, the boron nitride filled polyimide composite is thermally conductive but not electrically conductive, which may be a plus for battery packs to prevent the loss of electricity.       Update on Additive Manufacturing (AM) of Polyimide Composites by Principal Investigator (PI)   Traditional Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) uses the extruded thermoplastic polymer filaments by melting the filaments to carry out the 3D printing following CAD files.  Conventional laser sintering (LS) is another 3D printing technique that builds 3D objects layer by layer using laser to selectively melt cross-section of a powdered thermoplastic polymers.  However, the resultant 3D objects are often weaker in their strength due to the lack of polymer inter-chain connection in the z-direction  thus, limiting their use temperature to  200 C based on the commercial thermoplastic polymers.      Previously this PI has developed a melt-processable thermoset polyimide RTM370 resin powder, which can be subjected to laser sintering (LS) at 180 C to build a 3D  Green  object, and subsequently post-cured at 371 C in an oven to fully crosslink the reactive terminal groups within the resin into a network with a glass transition temperature (Tg, softening temperature) of 370 C. A high temperature thermoset polyimide carbon fiber composite bracket with  300  C capability was additively manufactured by laser sintering (LS) for the 1st time in collaboration with U. of Louisville and funded by the Air Force during 2016-2018.                image003     FDM (FFF)     b) Laser sintering of resin powder               c) LS-printed carbon fiber composites                                                                                          Recently the PI has also demonstrated the feasibility of 3D-printing composite specimens with boron nitride   (BN) filled RTM385-SLS polyimide resin powder by laser sintering to afford  Green  dogbone specimens, which was subsequently post-cured at 343 C to afford a 3-dimensional network of BN-polyimide composites with a Tg of 395 C and a thermal conductivity of 0.7 W m-K with a 6-7   porocity   a major accomplishent under TTT and AATT funding.  Therefore, it is feassible to 3D-print thermally conductive but electrically insulating battery packs by laser sintering, using BN-filled thermoset polyimide resins.             Text Box                                                  Post-cured 343 C                                                                 LS-printed BN-PI composites                       Cured BN-PI composites            Proposed battery pack    Objective and Innovation of This Proposal  An Improved Fused Powder Fabrication (FPF)   Although PI s previous advance in the state-of-the art of laser sintering of thermoset polyimides with boron nitride fillers has certainly made additive manufacturing of thermally conductive, but electrically insulating battery packs an attainable goal. However, the required use of vast area of powder bed in laser sintering creates a large amount of unused resin powder in the peripheral surrounding the desirable object.  It is the objective of this proposal to initiate a Fused Powder Fabrication (FPF) of melt-processable BN-filled thermoset polyimide that will print the actual 3D object directly very similar to Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) using thermoplastic filaments.  1) This fused thermoset polyimide powder fabrication approach will save cost on the valuable resin powder, and 2) the use of thermoset resin powder which can be further post-cure the as-printed  Green  object to achieve a higher use temperature than the commercial thermoplastic filaments can achieve.  It also eleminate the cost of extruding of filaments for FFF.   2) Project Plan   Using melt-processable thermoset polyimide resin powder, PI will collaborate with Hyrel 3D printing company to design a prototype Fused Powder 3D Printing Head that is capable of attaching to the existing commercial Hyrel 3D printer at GRC.  The goals are 1) demonstrate the capability of printing prototype 3D objects  such as square or dogbone-shaped tensile specimens. 2) print a prototype battery pack with high temperature of  300 C capability.

It also fits into GRC s Power and Energy Storage focus area. Battery packaging is the critical safety requirement for the success of power supply in space and electrified aircraft in aeronautic propulsion on Earth. The packaging materials typically prefer to be multifunctional  they must provide the necessary thermal and safety performance without significantly increasing the mass of the pack. Furthermore, additive manufacturing is an essential thrust in both STMD and GRC strategies.

Secondary TX  Battery components fit into TX.03.2.3  Aerospace Power and Energy Storage .       Technology Infusion or Transition Plan      When an additively manufactured composite battery pack is built, it will be transfer to Photovoltaic       Electrochemical Systems Branch (LEX) for evaluation in certain existing programs for space        power and electrified aircraft applications.       GRC s RTM imide resins are already licensed to Imitec Inc. as a commercial product, and a patent has        been filed in 2019 for the said laser sintering technology to make high temperature thermoset        composites with  300   C capability.      This same technology of fused powder fabrication of melt-processable thermoset polyimide composites       can also be used to build the Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) for reentry as these polyimide resin        have shown to have higher char yield than the state-or-the-art of phenolics.      4) Contingency Project Plan    In a hypothetical instance that the proposed fused powder fabrication (FPF) method was not successfully in demonstrating the technology advance after 4-month of trying, the team always has a fall back plan of 3D-printing the battery packs by laser sintering of RTM385-SLS polyimide resin with h-BN fillers, which has demonstrated its feasibility in the introduction section of this proposal.

Modeling and mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement of GRX-810 alloy for hydrogen propulsion storage tanks,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title    Modeling and mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement of GRX-810 alloy for hydrogen propulsion storage tanks          Cryogenic hydrogen fueled aircraft (under development at NASA GRC, Airbus, etc.) is one of the options to slash CO2 emissions related to air transportation. The main issue with using hydrogen in aircraft is its very low density  1 . Storing hydrogen in its liquid state (at cryogenic temperature) is one of the methods to increase the density. Liquid hydrogen storage tank needs to be resistant to hydrogen embrittlement and capable of structurally withstanding the temperatures of liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement is a reduction in the ductility of the structural material (metal alloy) due to absorbed hydrogen. The main goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects of hydrogen absorption on ductility of the alloy GRX-810  2 , that is under development at NASA GRC. GRX-810 is a new breakthrough 3D-printable alloy with remarkable high temperature properties, e.g., creep. It is an oxide dispersion-strengthened alloy with a Ni-Co-Cr matrix. Preliminary tests of this alloy at cryogenic temperatures also show promising results (Yield Strength (YS) T 77K   0.9 GPa, Elongation to Failure (EF), or ductility T 77K   40 ). We note that recently developed Ni-Co-Cr-based Medium Entropy Alloys (MEAs) in general demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures, e.g., a remarkable increase in strength accompanied by a simultaneous increase in ductility (YS T 77K   0.7 GPa, EF T 77K   90 , FT T 77K   280 MPa m1 2), with decreasing deformation temperature from Room Temperature (RT) to cryogenic temperatures  3 . The diffusivity of hydrogen (e.g., along the grain boundaries), its segregation at lattice defects and the corresponding effects on deformation behavior (e.g., ductility) have not been quantified in the literature for Ni-Co-Cr-based MEAs, in general, and GRX-810 alloy, in particular. Atomistic modeling and simulations are perfectly suited to study the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement in full atomic detail and provide recommendations for novel alloy compositions that improve deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures. Our proposed effort will be leveraged by the capabilities we already have. In particular, the Density Functional Theory- (DFT) informed simulation potential for Ni-Co-Cr, recently developed in our group, will be used for this project, along with the state-of-the-art atomistic simulation techniques (including ab-initio, molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo, and their combinations)  4, 5 .                First, we will fit the interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr-H (using the existent interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr, recently developed in our group), to enable realistic modeling of hydrogen diffusion and segregation at lattice defects in the material. Next, the segregation of hydrogen at lattice defects (e.g., grain boundaries) will be investigated, employing hybrid Molecular Dynamics   kinetic Monte Carlo (MD MC) simulations. And finally, the effects of hydrogen segregation on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures will be studied. In particular, a series of MD deformation tests will be carried out at cryogenic temperatures, varying the amount of hydrogen (and the amounts individual Ni, Co, Cr elements) in the simulation system containing a lattice defect, which would serve as a sink for hydrogen (e.g., a grain boundary). The successful accomplishment of the proposed work will lead to identifying the composition that most effectively improves the performance of the material at cryogenic temperatures.        The anticipated milestones will include the following     ab initio calculations for the H energetics in the Ni-Co-Cr alloys.   Interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr-H, suitable for simulation of hydrogen diffusion in the Ni-Co-Cr alloys.   Effects of hydrogen, segregated at a lattice defect (e.g., grain boundary) on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures.   Effects of Ni-Co-Cr composition (by varying the amount of individual Ni, Co, Cr elements in the simulation system) on the above behavior.           In the next step we will study the behavior of the composite system, containing hard oxide (Y2O3) particles embedded in the Ni-Co-Cr-based matrix, under deformation at cryogenic temperature. The interface between the oxide particle and Ni-Co-Cr-based matrix will possibly serve as a sink for the absorbed hydrogen. The effects of hydrogen segregation at this interface on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures will be studied, as well as the effects of solute atoms segregating at the interface on the above processes will be investigated and recommendations will be made regarding solute additions that maximally improve the deformation behavior.         Dedicated experiments will be carried out at NASA GRC to test the theoretically obtained results. If successful, the proposed project will enable a number of new Air Space applications for the GRX-810 alloy, e.g., as a structural material for cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage tanks (liquid hydrogen-fueled aircraft technology  under development at NASA GRC, etc.).           The results of MD MC simulations heavily depend on the quality of interatomic potential. Our initial choice is the Finnis-Sinclair semi-empirical potentials which are the computationally cheapest reasonable interatomic potentials for metals. However, if we find that this type of potential cannot reproduce our ab initio data obtained within first 3 months, we will switch to machine learning (ML) potentials.      References     1  A.J.

"Energy Efficient, Out-of-Autoclave Manufacturing of Thermoplastic Composites for Aircraft Structures",TTT Green Aviation,,"Title  Energy Efficient, Out-of-Autoclave Manufacturing of Thermoplastic Composites for Aircraft Structures. Background  Industry enthusiasm around thermoplastic composites (TPCs) is seeing a resurgence due to the potential for rapid manufacture of large aerospace structures. TPC matrices differ from the traditionally utilized thermosetting resins in that fabrication of a thermoplastic (TP) part requires only heating the material above its softening temperature and applying pressure to consolidate multiple layers of material. Currently, this process requires consolidation in a press or autoclave. The autoclave process for TPs has a substantial energy requirement for heating and cooling (processing temperatures are higher for TPs than thermosets) and autoclave press consolidation requires non-reusable, consumable materials. However, opportunity for manufacturing flexibility exists for TPs because the requirement for consolidating thermoplastics includes only heat and pressure. Of particular interest is out-ofautoclave consolidation. Problem  Out-of-autoclave or  in-situ  consolidation eliminates the energy intensive processing step of autoclave or press consolidation. To date, mechanical tests on parts manufactured by this process have shown a reduction in interlaminar strength. Previous work at the University of Delaware studied the physical mechanisms controlling laminate quality during in-situ consolidation by automated fiber placement (AFP). Process variables such as heat transfer, inter-ply contact time, and void reduction were modeled, tested, and quantified. The causes of inadequate consolidation were correlated with process, material, and machine parameters. The study concluded that heat transfer, lay-down speed, and consolidation pressure were the principle controllable process variables affecting laminate quality. (1,2) Current AFP and braiding processes do not support the time, temperature or pressure requirements to allow single-step production of aerospace quality composites. Has someone tried to solve the problem before. Out-of-autoclave processes have been attempted and is an area of active research but, to date, has been unsuccessful in meeting the mechanical properties achievable by traditional processing methods. The issue is partly due to time, temperature, and pressure requirements as described above. However, this cannot be the entire story as well-established fusion bonding processes such as induction welding and ultrasonic welding are very rapid in nature and still yield strong bonds. The fundamental difference between these welding processes and in-situ consolidation is in the number of heating and cooling cycles experienced per ply of the TPC during fabrication and consolidation. When carbon fiber thermoplastic plies are consolidated the air trapped between those layers is condensed by the consolidation pressure and absorbed in the matrix. In-situ consolidation by AFP, for example heats every ply as it is laid down, and several plies beneath. Each time a layer is reheated, trapped air expands, eventually leading to interlaminar void formation and reduced interlaminar mechanical properties. Where did they go wrong what is different about this approach  There is evidence to suggest that the issue with current approaches is related to the repeated heating and cooling of  consecutive plies during laminate fabrication. Work supported through a GRC 2022 Center Innovation Fund (CIF) has demonstrated that at least 8 plies of a braided preform can be successfully consolidated in one step by an induction welding approach, with dynamic crush properties comparable to autoclave consolidated parts.(3) Induction welding is a common thermoplastic joining technique and is effective for consolidating a braided composite architecture. Here we propose exploring ultrasonic welding as well, which provides a lower cost alternative and greater composite design flexibility than the induction welding process. A New Technology Report was submitted for this manufacturing approach within the NASA GRC NTR system and the work will be presented at the CAMX conference in Atlanta, GA. 1. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. We propose a building block approach to demonstrate this technology with the success metric including (1) laminate consolidation and (2) interlaminar mechanical properties that are comparable to press or autoclave processed composites. a. Literature and market survey to assess full environmental impact of in-situ consolidation. b. Establish in-house capability for in-situ consolidation. c. Coupon Subcomponent Coupon Data  apply building block approach to verify that consolidation and strength metrics can be met with single-step consolidation processes. This includes in-situ consolidation and mechanical tests. d. Budget  Costs for this project are associated with materials, manufacturing, and test. This includes a contract for welding (out of autoclave consolidation) while concurrently building the capability in-house. Previous work at GRC has demonstrated out of autoclave consolidation with induction welding. In this activity we would like to explore other options. 2. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? This work will establish feasibility of the material class to enable sustainable aviation through reduced energy manufacturing costs. Next steps include but are not limited to the following. a. Evaluate feasibility through consolidation of a representative structure, i.e., variable thickness and diameter. b. Manufacture braided subscale fuselage and wings. Explore opportunity to leverage the AFRL DMAAPS (Design for Manufacture of Attritable Aircraft Primary Structure) program. In this program the AFRL manufactured a braided fuselage and wings of a small, UAM size aircraft with an out of autoclave thermosetting epoxy. Using their tool and design for manufacturing would allow direct comparison to cost, time, energy savings and consolidation quality of our process with that of a state-of-the-art material and process. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial  proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? c. Fusion welding is a well-established process for joining thermoplastic composite parts. The novelty and risk associated with this proposal is using the fusion welding processes for consolidation purposes. In the event this is not technically feasible the project can pivot to documenting the strength and stiffness knockdown inherent to in-situ consolidation with the understanding that the applications may be acceptable for attritable aircraft and or unmanned vehicles.

High Lift High Load LPT Blade for Hybrid Engine,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE Title  High Lift High Load LPT Blade Design for Hybrid Turbine Engines Problem Statement Hybrid electric aircraft concepts, in general, offer the potential to downsize the core design of turbine engines, a concept currently under examination in the HyTEC program. Additionally, they provide operational benefits influenced by developments through TTT initiative. Both endeavors aim to enhance the efficiency of turbine engine components while increasing the overall bypass ratio of the aircraft. It is important to acknowledge that there are inevitable challenges associated with the downsizing of engine components, which must be addressed. While HyTEC focuses on promptly finding solutions to these challenges for near future, it is imperative to remain mindful of and proactively tackle the technical difficulties that might affect such efforts for the long term. On the other hand, new aircraft concepts like SUSAN and STARC-ABL aim to hybridize aircraft operations by employing turbine engines to power electric machines, thus further increasing the aircraft's overall bypass ratio. In order fully unlock the potential advantages offered by these conceptual aircraft architectures, it is imperative to comprehend and address the challenges and potential enhancements that will impact the turbine engine. In the turbine engine, high pressure, and low-pressure turbines (HPT and LPT) are responsible for providing the energy to run the high pressure and low-pressure compressors (HPC and LPC) respectively as well as providing excess energy for auxiliary components of the aircraft. the significance of the turbines, particularly the LPT, should not be underestimated 1 . Understanding the flow physics in LPT is vital and presents a significant challenge, leading to an intricate design process. On one hand, the LPT must perform optimally in high Reynolds number (    ) condition near sea level where maximum loading is required for take-off. On the other hand, the majority of the flight time is spent at high altitude cruise condition where the air density results in a lower      and lower momentum flow in LPT section2 . Low-     conditions can be particularly troublesome, as the lower momentum flow is prone to separation and transition effects due to the adverse pressure gradient experienced on the suction surface of the blade. Off-design operating conditions in the LPT section result in performance degradation due to this flow separation. This phenomenon known as Reynolds lapse3 can be intensified as the LPT gets smaller due to the smaller core of the future engines. Also, concepts seeking burning Hydrogen as a fuel will decrease      more and contributing to such losses even further. Multiple research efforts have addressed Reynolds lapse in LPTs with the most recent one conducted by air force research laboratory4 through optimal design of high lift high, high load low pressure turbine blades. All the current and previous works in this field seek to optimize the design of turbine blades in the traditional setting of gas turbine engines. The proposed work here seeks to utilize the design work conducted through TTT in Operability Influenced Design (OID) to investigate the possibility of understanding the design space for high-load high-lift LPT blades for hybrid electric engines. OID currently focuses on redesigning HPC component of a typical gas turbine engine by realizing the possible benefits of addition of electric motors to the engine enabled by Turbine Electrified Energy Management (TEEM) concept. Through this design practice it became evident that high-load blade design and optimization of turbine and compressor blades is required to fully realize any possible benefits which can be enabled by such control concepts or use of novel fuels such as hydrogen. Investigating such design spaces requires utilizing tools to allow for correct estimation of the flow field and flow transition that occurs at low-     in LPT. NASA currently lacks such crucial tools  and thus is incapable of conducting thorough analysis on the blade design to investigate correct benefits of these technologies on the engine components. OID mostly benefits the design of the compressor section which is tied to LPT and HPT closely. Moreover, there are similarities in the design process which can be translated from the turbine section to the compressor section. This work will to investigate the feasibility of designing high-load high-lift LPT blades for hybrid-electric aircrafts in cooperation with air force research laboratory through a one-year effort. Through this design process, significant expertise and blade design capability will be transferred to NASA work force. Approach The work will be divided in three phases with each contributing to a milestone. Milestone 1  2 months from actual start date (AS)   The requirements for the LPT blade design will be identified using a NASA    3 engine as a relevant open system which can be applied to both NASA OID effort and power extraction technical challenge under HyTEC. This milestone will be completed by defining the loading at each stage of the LPT according to a high lift, high load blade design approach. This milestone will be completed by providing a detailed requirements for each blade row of the    3 LPT. The substantial volume of data accessible for this engine design guarantees a high level of confidence in achieving this milestone. Milestone 2  10 months from AS   The first stage LPT blade design space will be explored based on the requirements identified in milestone 1. Turbine Design and Analysis System (TDAAS) will be used in this effort. It is a tool currently utilized by air force research laboratory to perform similar type of analysis for traditional turbine engines. TDAAS uses an airfoil generator along with a grid generator and flow solver to build the workflow for blade design. The various first stage LPT blade designs generated through this system will be evaluated aerodynamically first along with physical buildability. This milestone will be completed by designing the first stage blades for a hybrid-electric high-lift high-load LPT. In the event that we do not fully attain this milestone, it will provide us with a deeper understanding of the technical hurdles associated with LPT design necessitated by a reduction in the engine core size. This, in turn, will guide us in pinpointing areas for future research focus. Nevertheless, as a positive outcome, NASA stands to gain valuable expertise in blade design and optimization, which will prove indispensable for numerous ongoing research initiatives, including but not limited to addressing power extraction technical challenge in the HyTEC project, OID, SUSAN, and endeavors related to thermal management for energy extraction from the engine core. Milestone 3  12 months from AS   The blade design achieved in milestone 2 will inform the researchers on the feasibility of the high lift, high load blade design for the other four stages of the LPT. While a thorough redesign of the blades is required to accurately assess any possible benefits in LPT, it will not be in the scope of this work. However, analytical methods can be utilized to estimate such benefits and investigate the possibility of reducing the stages in this LPT. This milestone will provide an analysis of the overall benefits to the LPT design through the analysis of the engine system with a redesigned LPT in NPSS. If Milestone 2 is successfully accomplished, this task can be carried out using analytical methods based on the principles of turbomachinery design. However, if the second milestone is only partially achieved or not completed, it will provide valuable insights into the system-level constraints when designing high-load LPTs. This, in turn, will enhance the realism of evaluating new aircraft or engine concepts. Upon its successful conclusion, this endeavor will primarily enable NASA to acquire the knowledge and resources essential for in-depth blade design of turbine engine components. While initially the licenses for software in this  effort should be purchased, it is the goal of this work to subsequently integrate these methodologies with NASA's internal tools, including NPSS, OTAC, FUN3D, and others, to empower researchers in the design or redesign of turbomachinery blades. This approach will facilitate the development of innovative conceptual architectures and the tools required to effectively evaluate potential advantages stemming from new technologies. Furthermore, this work will offer valuable insights for the OID and SUSAN projects, as well as forthcoming projects focused on the assessment of new fuels and engine concepts. Special Scenario ""If it proves unfeasible to design new high-lift, high-load blades, the project can easily shift its focus towards the redesign of the compressor within the OID work. This effort aimed to develop a new HPC design for the    3 by leveraging the advantages of adding electric machines to the engine. In this context, the ongoing work can reallocate its resources to delve deeper into the aforementioned effort, exploring the redesign of one or multiple stages within the new HPC concept. While the primary goal of this effort is to attain expertise and tools for blade design, it will still contribute to the project's success. References 1. Walker, G.J., 1993.

Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel Aircraft - a path to zero emissions,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL Title  Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel Aircraft   a path to zero emissions 1. The work will build upon the dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept first demonstrated in 1956 to enable a path to low emissions, which reduced demands on renewable energy and infrastructure, towards zero emissions. The dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept retains the wing tanks and economically adds hydrogen to a 737-class single aisle offloading Jet A to retain the same range enabling flexible aircraft operations and paths forward. Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel aircraft with only 2080km of zero emission range, or 30  hydrogen by energy can reduce emissions by 50  can be raised to an astonishing 97.5  at lower and more stable fuel costs than SAF and Jet A. The low energy per unit volume of hydrogen introduces significant aviation challenges for 100  LH2 fueled aircraft to economically meet the stringent mass, volume, and safety requirements and the first order optimum is  30  LH2 by energy. The 97.5  U.S. emissions reduction will require a change in the airline business model. The dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept is a significant departure from the 2021 U.S. Aviation Climate Action Plan based on drop-in carbon-based Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and most importantly, is not a  farther term technology  that also retains the current Aero portfolio to offset increases in cost. The U.S. Climate Action Plan stated that there was no expectation that LH2 aircraft would make a significant contribution towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The much slower adoption of hydrogen fuel was also based primarily upon the need to access renewable energy and to develop ground storage and distribution systems, and to a lesser extent, upon the need mature electric and hydrogen technologies and to tackle several other technical and safety challenges. The 2020 European Hydrogen Aircraft study cited a derived need for  4300GW for 100  SAF vs 1450 GW for 100  LH2--likely overlooked--while 30  LH2 would require 435 GW, a ten-fold decrease, but must add back liquefaction energy. By relying on off-grid and excess energy, LH2 production will not have to rely on grid provided renewable energy. Note that plant based SAF may only achieve 25  carbon emission reduction,  4X less than carbon free hydrogen and SAF via direct air capture. At present, 2050 SAF goals are unstainable beyond  not achieving the net-zero by 2050 goal . In general, limited supply SAF (HEFA) is the lowest cost while unbounded supply based on direct air capture  a massive green prize  plus green LH2 (PtL e-kerosene) is the highest cost fuel. SAF s have predicted costs 2-10x the cost of Jet A, creating a significant risk to national and world security, in an attempt to limit aircraft and infrastructure modifications, besides incorrectly assuming SAF would require less renewable energy and that off-grid, excess renewable energy is not available, which would favor hydrogen. The U.S. Climate Action Plan correctly identified that Aviation  must change the fuel  to meet net zero goals and that technology alone showcased in the in EPFD and TTBW X-66A demonstrators would  not  be sufficient. In  contrast , hydrogen aircraft would become the pull technology in fewer higher energy locations to help eliminate grid bottlenecks and reduce emissions in the hard to decarbonize industries. In contrast, rather than remove fuselage and engines from a MD-90 to form the TTBW X66A, adding hydrogen tanks could fly the same number of PAX with hydrogen plumbed to the rear-mounted engines. The Airbus A380 LH2 demonstrator adds a 3rd hydrogen engine cantilevered from the fuselage along with the hydrogen fuel system and tank. In contrast, while the truss braced wing is an excellent design for battery and 100  hydrogen aircraft since  no energy will be carried in the wings, the lower amount of jet fuel carried must be further considered in a dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept. In the proposed work, hydrogen must be approached from a systems level, because it won t work unless you have all the pieces to make it work from an operating system. Since hydrogen production results from off-grid and or excess renewable energy, dual fuel does not have to be dependent on grid green energy and wait 30 years. Conversely, objectives are achieved when a bottoms-up understanding of the assumptions, physics, and resources including those outside NASA s domain are tracked, compared, and traded versus vehicle system goals requiring proper communication insight, including what happens when projects are not priorities or technology risks are not properly identified, and subsystems are not compatible. Safety cannot be assessed without integrated designs and hardware. Indeed, many others recognize one must limit the need for renewable energy and potential infrastructure buildup and dual fuel enables aircraft flexibility across the globe while significantly reducing emissions economically. UH   Boeing and Airbus are likely to develop a replacement for these venerable models (single aisles dominated by the B737 and A320) for entry into service in the mid-2030s. The only way aviation can meet Paris Agreement emissions targets is if the new single aisle airplanes are hydrogen powered.   A hydrogen single aisle does not need to be a radical new design  an unstretched MD-90 or a  Transatlantic Concept  flying the same number of PAX as a A320 needs to be examined, as well as adding the unducted fan ultra-high-bypass engine, to name but a few paths to explore. A 100  hydrogen powered aircraft increases fuel volume over four-fold versus a conventional aircraft occupying cargo and passenger space, while 30  hydrogen by energy can provide 50 to 97.5  reduction in emissions via 2080km of zero emissions range to tackle the easy part of the range sooner and more economically with 9 times less energy than ekerosine Power-to-Liquid (plus liquefaction energy) at 2 to 10 times less cost than SAF. The dual fuel concept--ready for short term demonstrations as there are no insurmountable problems--opens up the design space for further out technologies including those beyond NASA and all of the areas identified in this Green Aviation New work  Alternative Propulsion, Aircraft Design, Materials and Manufacturing, Air Traffic Management, Emission Control, Sustainable Infrastructure, and Contrail Formation requiring  100Ms not  M. Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel aircraft with 14  hydrogen by weight can reduce emissions safely by 50 to 97.5  to supplement SAF reductions at less costs, and more importantly, will reduce demands on renewable energy and infrastructure. The work will perform studies of the dual  hydrogen-jet fuel concepts and many key components, describe key SAF challenges and limitations, outline the pathways, challenges, and infrastructure changes for dual fuel aircraft and technologies to speed the transition safely and economically to beyond net zero. 2. The work will further examine the strengths and weaknesses of the dual fuel concept to reduce emissions by 50  sooner and more economically than SAF within the time frame of the award and resources provided. Benefits and opportunities for dual hydrogen-jet fuel electric propulsion will be described. The milestone is to provide sufficient justification that leads to a demonstration path or to be unlikely usurped by alternative approaches. Many innovative design details and the 97.5  justification are not described due to proposal limits but will be further developed as bottoms up design is required for system assessments, to address safety. 3. The limited resource Green Aviation New Work is only a path to zero emissions which will require  Bs to place aircraft into service, identify the limitations and hence opportunities for further R D in an expanded design space that transcends NASA a significant effort beyond the PI abilities to raise the TRL. Before this work is completed, NASA could outsource the same work to a University Led Initiative, add a task to the Truss Braced Wing Demonstrator, have another organization help develop a key technology( e.g., tanks), or collaborate further with other agencies to develop the infrastructure, to name just a few. 4. If the concepts are not technically feasible, it then creates the opportunity to examine or ignore alternatives and or breakdown current approach to the key challenges likely presenting opportunities to other disciplines. Proposal constraints prevents addressing many detailed design issues. Innovation occurs when folks presented with a problem ask,  how may we look at this differently . How one pivots depends on many factors, but especially on how complete the current approach was examined. With so many areas to investigate listed above, it will require a re-examination of the path forward to first expand and then contract the trade space with data. Another factor is that SMEs are not always correct, and often do not present limitations clearly, so it s important to understand the rationale for this assessment, especially if new data methods and or a breakthrough overcomes the limitation. In the case of dual fuel, the most obvious alternative approach is SAF via DAC that becomes sustainable or funded by DOD for National Security, which is only a small fraction of NASA domain, so this is a limited opportunity. A logical pivot would be toward technology to reduce fuel burn to reduce resources required for zero emissions. The pivot would have to make an impact since there are no rewards for failure in a very mature and challenging industry since the story being told in general is that one shifts to line or project management. Further developing AI, propulsion, electrical, materials, and other discipline and technology skills almost always help develop paths forward so will also be included in the pivot options-perhaps better than let the team understand that path forward is unlikely.",,,,,,

Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger. Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template. RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW Title  Computational Design of Superconductors for Superconducting Aircraft Propulsion Motors 1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not? How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches? If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate. All electric airflights offer climate-neutral aviation by greatly reducing carbon emission  1 . However, the traditional electric motor is limited by its power density, i.e., the power to weight ratio. Superconducting aircraft propulsion motors have the potential of achieving power densities 2-3 times the state of the art for machines in the megawatt (MW) or larger class with   99  efficiency  2 . This requires superconductors to carry very strong current, and therefore, the superconductor coils  3,4  must be kept well below its superconducting critical temperature. Currently, the high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs), in particular, cuprates (such as GdBa2Cu3O7 films)  5  are used in such motors and must be cooled to below 20 K by liquid hydrogen, although their critical temperatures are well above 77 K, the boiling point of nitrogen. However, liquid hydrogen is not only expensive but also poses a substantial risk to safety. Previous researches in this field have been focused on designing new structures of the superconducting motors while employing the existing cuprate HTSCs. Though this approach has led to operational superconducting motors with much improved energy to weight ratio compared with the traditional ones, the target MW and larger class are still beyond reach without considering new superconductors which can carry stronger current and or at higher temperatures. Such researches on new superconductors require totally different technical expertise than what the engineering groups working on this filed usually have. In this project, we propose to computationally design novel superconductors, in addition to current researches on designing novel motor structures. The combination of these two approaches has the potential of reaching the desired energy density at a much higher output power scale. Furthermore, previous theoretical researches  6  on superconductors have been mostly dedicated on predicting the critical temperatures  !, and very few efforts  7,8  have been spent to consider and calculate the critical current density as a function of temperature and to find out superconductors with higher critical current.  Technically, the critical current density  ( ) has the same temperature dependence as that of the superconducting gap amplitude  ( ), and  ( ) can be obtained theoretically by solving the coupled integration equations for superconducting and total charge densities, respectively, which are a direct consequence of the well-known mean-field BCS theory  9 . To obtain  ( ) and  ( ), firstly, one has to calculate the critical temperature  !, which depends on a number of physical quantities according to the BCS relation and the McMillan s analysis  10    !     1.45 exp    1           (1   0.62 ) 7  .   . Here   is the Debye temperature,    the Coulomb repulsion, and   the electron-phonon coupling constant. These three key quantities are also needed to obtain the parameters in the coupled integration equations. We note that nowadays  ,    and   can be computed by solving the quantum mechanical equations (first- -principles electronic structure calculations) routinely and accurately, and the calculated  ! based on the above McMillian s expression can be quantitatively comparable with the measured data. Thus, a breakthrough has been made in superconductivity research, and one prominent example is the experimental discoveries of the high-T superconductor SH3 under high pressure after the first-principles calculations were carried out. In 2014, Duan et al.  11  predicted  ! of 200 K under a pressure of 160-200 GPa for SH3, while in 2015 Drozdov et al.  12  measured  ! of 203 K under 160 GPa. Besides first-principles calculations, machine learning and data mining  13  have been successfully applied to find new superconductors and to determine their  !  14 . Our group members have employed, tailored and developed both first-principles and high-throughput computational tools to compute lattice vibrations (phonons) and electron-phonon coupling in metals and insulators. These tools can be used to accurately evaluate  ,    and   and to fast screen materials by efficiently estimating these quantities. Furthermore, our group members have used machine learning and data mining methods to study battery materials and biomaterials, and this expertise is directly transferrable for superconductor research. Superconductivity research requires close collaborations between theory and experiments since theory alone or experiments alone are prone to errors and false claims  15,16 . Our experimental collaborator, Prof. Chen in University of Houston, is a world-renowned expert on HTSC and topological superconductors  17-19 . Combining our theory computation and their materials synthesis and characterization will be the key for us to find out superconductors which can carry stronger electric current at higher T for making aircraft motors. As summarized in Figure 1 on the right, there exist five different types of superconductors forming more than 12,000 known superconductors listed in the SuperCon database  20 . Guided by the existing data, known empirical rules and experimental observations, we will employ the high-throughput screening and machine learning and data mining to find out potential candidates. Then we will apply the accurate first-principles methods to compute  ' and  ( ) for these materials. Finally, our theoretical findings of the most promising candidates will be synthesized and measured by our experimental collaborators. Fig. 1  The major advances in superconductivity vs year  6 . 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. During the first year of the work, we will focus solely on employing, developing, and examining firstprinciples methods to calculate the superconducting critical temperature  ! and the critical current density  ( ). As mentioned previously, methods to compute the associated crucial physical quantities of  ,    and   have been implemented in many popular first-principles programs such as VASP  21  and ABINIT  22 , but we need to program the code to solve the coupled integration equations to obtain the superconducting gap amplitude,  ( ), and then  ( ). However, reaching the desired accuracy for    and   is still very challenging, since multiple approximations are involved and we need to carefully examine these approximate models and numerical convergence for different types of superconductors. Some existing models need to be further improved or simplified to increase accuracy or efficiency so that these quantities can be calculated within certain tolerable errors and reasonable computation cost. The anticipated milestones are the errors in the calculated critical current and critical temperature are within 50  and 25 , respectively, compared with experimental data for a few prototypical superconductors belonging to five different types as illustrated in Figure 1, with particular emphasis on calculating and comparing critical current for superconductors currently used in superconducting aircraft motors. 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? After this work is finished, we shall possess the computational capabilities of accurately evaluating the critical current density in different types of superconductors from first principles. Next, we will employ and develop the high-throughput tools to compute these quantities, so that we can do fast screening among the existing 12,000 superconductors and novel possible compositions. The machine learning and data mining methods will also be built and tested, as an alternative approach to find out potential candidates for further theoretical investigations using the first-principles methods. Then we will combine these computational approaches with experimental measurements to find out either existing or new superconductors, which can carry twice of the maximum current the present HTSC films can do and or which can carry the same maximum current as before at temperatures higher than 77 K. Twice of maximum current would increase the output power density of the aircraft motors by 300 . 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? After three months into this work, if we find that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically, we will first identify the cause. The approach based on first-principles calculations that we described in the first session has been implemented in many codes and has been tested for numerous superconductors with varying degrees of accuracy on the calculated  !. Large errors in  ! normally means that the calculated  ,    and   are not sufficiently accurate, which will also severely affect the accuracy in the predicted  ( ), when solving the coupled integration equations. The Deby temperature   normally can be predicted very accurately, while the Coulomb repulsion    and electron-phonon coupling constant   are much harder to be obtained with sufficient accuracy. We will (1) examine and improve the theoretical models and numerical convergence  (2) use machine learning and data mining techniques to obtain these two values from the SuperCon database and other existing theoretical results and measured data  (3) employ phenomenological models, which are based on physics considerations, but whose parameters are often fitted to measured data.

Enhanced Aerogel Composites for Lithium-Ion Battery Performance Safety and Efficiency (ECLIPSE),TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Enhanced Aerogel Composites for Lithium-Ion Battery Performance Safety and Efficiency (ECLIPSE)   PROJECT DESCRIPTION    Concern over climate change has created an opportunity and need to target new aircraft technologies for the next generation of single-aisle airliners which account for greater than 50  of worldwide aviation emissions. NASA Projects such as the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) and the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) are tasked with the development of technology and designs for aircraft to meet greener low emission objectives and enable a new generation of electric-powered aircraft. Within the electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) technologies under EPFD, higher efficiency batteries are of significant interest. Over the past few decades, battery technologies have seen exceptional advancement, however, thermal control and thermal runaway continues to be a challenge.  To combat this issue, an advanced material with phase change capability is necessary to absorb or redirect thermal energy during normal operation and protect cells from the extreme heat produced during a thermal runaway event. One such potential material is a Phase Change-Polymer Aerogel Composite (PCPAC), which will offer the advantages of a typical aerogel such as extremely low density (  0.1 g cm3),1 high porosity (  95 ),2 high specific surface area (500 1,000 m2 g),3 and mechanical strength4.       Current methods for thermal management and thermal runaway prevention impose a significant weight penalty. Current assumptions when designing an energy storage system for electric aircraft state that 30  of the overall mass of the system is the packaging of the batteries, which includes the methods of thermal management and thermal runaway propagation prevention. To achieve a realistic solution for electrified aircraft, 400 Watt hours kilogram (Wh kg) at the battery module level is the minimum energy density limit. Current Lithium-Ion cells have an energy density of up to 250 Wh kg, giving an energy density of 175 Wh kg at the battery module. As energy densities at the battery cell level increase, the weight penalty will remain, and possibly even increase based on the advanced cell chemistry characteristics.   Aluminum is mainly used as a thermal and physical barrier between cells and has a density of 2.7 g cm3. Replacing some of the aluminum used for packaging with a low-density aerogel (0.1 g cm3) will allow for substantial weight savings and a decreased percentage of parasitic mass for the battery module while also acting as an effective thermal management material and a lightweight barrier to thermal runaway propagation.     In this study we will demonstrate a new approach to 3D printing polyimide aerogel composites with phase change material capability using the facile, cost-effective process of direct ink writing (DIW) without the need for extreme conditions or additional post-processing steps. This will be accomplished by using a dual-head syringe to print the high temperature resistant polymer aerogel in combination with the target temperature polymer to infiltrate the pores whereby the aerogel acts as a host system for the phase change material. Expanding access to non-moldable complex structures via 3D printing will enable aerogels to insulate more complex arrangements of electronic components. Looking forward, the use of custom-fit aerogels for lightweight thermal insulation of batteries can facilitate electric vehicle and electric aviation applications.   References    P. R. Aravind, P.

All polymer synthesis will be verified via typical characterization methods to determine thermal conductivity, density, mechanical strength, and resistance to target temperatures. The 3D printed structure will be evaluated by the ability to enhance performance of the target battery. The milestones are as follows    Milestone   Title   Description   Timeline post award   1   Baseline feasibility study   Entails deep dive into current SOA materials for enhanced battery life followed by a comparison study of baseline aerogels.

However, lower room-temperature ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact currently limits the use of solid-state electrolytes for high performance applications. These limitations can be mitigated by increasing the operating temperature, thus increasing the ionic conductivity. As such, the ability to maintain high temperature throughout operation is critical for harnessing solid-state batteries for electric aviation, and lightweight, custom-fit aerogel insulators have potential to address this concern. This application has direct correlation with TTT Convergent Aeronautic Solutions  projects Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety for Electric Aircraft (SABERS) and Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD). The successful outcome of this proposed work would directly impact commercial electrified aircraft as well as have significant interest to other mission directorates such as SMD and STMD.    Project Viability   In the event that the viability of this material does not meet our key performance parameters early on, the possibilities of using alternative chemistries are vast. The structure of the polyimide aerogel that will house the phase change material has been demonstrated through a suite of patents which lends to a high level of confidence for its success. The phase change material can be made from a myriad of chemistries targeting various temperatures. The intention is to perform an optimization study for just this purpose. The study will easily shift to different methods of synthesis or 3D printing if needed.  ",,,,,,
Thermal Management System Trade Study and Analysis for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Aircraft,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title  Thermal Management System Trade Study and Analysis for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Aircraft 1. NASA s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) recently published their updated Strategic Implementation Plan which calls for increasing focus on sustainable aviation and achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Alternative propulsion is an area of specific interest, and one method involves hydrogen fuel cells. Through NASA s ongoing Commercially-viable Hydrogen Aircraft for Reduction of Greenhouse Emissions (CH2ARGE) project, this technology is thoroughly being assessed through different aircraft design cycles. This project focuses on medium range aircraft with around 180 passengers and a range of about 2,500 nmi, which falls into the category of short-medium range aircraft that generate about two-thirds of the CO2 emissions generated by this industryi . There are different types of fuel cells, but the basic idea is that by reacting both hydrogen and oxygen gas, one can produce power with water and heat as byproducts  therefore, if designed properly, the aircraft can be a net-zero CO2 emitter. A significant obstacle to adopting fuel cells as a power source for aircraft is that the thermal management system (TMS) must handle multiple challenges. A benefit of fuel cells is that they are  50  , which is higher than the  30   efficiency of the traditional jet engine cycle. However, unlike traditional aircraft, the hot gases generated by the propulsion system don t just exit through the back of the engine  rather, in fuel cell systems, the heat is contained in the fuel cell stack and must be conducted out and either dissipated or put to good use supporting a secondary system. This becomes problematic as the propulsion system for a mid-size aircraft will require 20   25 MW of power, meaning that the fuel cells will be producing about 10 MW of heat. Ample consideration must also be given to the quality of heat generated, since heat dissipation to the surroundings becomes more difficult and complex as the ambient air becomes warmer. Another significant challenge is that the aircraft s high energy-dense hydrogen fuel has cryogenic needs to be operationally feasible. The design of a relevant TMS would require significant consideration for hydrogen boil-off, refrigeration, insulation, and others, since all are nontrivial technical challenges that will substantially impact the TMS design. However, the potential a cryogenic hydrogen fuel offers is also promising, as this opens multiple design paths not offered in traditional aircraft. For example, the TMS could leverage any boil-off from the tank to condition or further cool critical aircraft components and potentially open the doors towards super-conducting applications. All the above are complex problems that must be addressed for net-zero CO2 emissions in aviation to be successful, which is why it is important that NASA address this problem now. We have conducted a survey on the different TMS used by various NASA-funded internal and academic projects of similar electrical scaleii, iii, iv, vand have found the above issues to be consistent challenges facing the industry with increasing electrification. Promising technologies that would enable a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft include using oscillating heat pipe spreaders on the aircraft skin vi , using liquid hydrogen flow loops to cool componentsvii , and using thermal storage devicesviii in conjunction with more traditional pumped-fluid loopsix . Despite the many technologies mentioned above, the design of the TMS has consistently been found to be a major area requiring development that lacks the appropriate priority in the design cycle of aircraft   it is consistently an afterthought that results in severe performance penalties. With increasing electrification, the TMS system must now be designed in-tandem with other major systems to develop a viable aircraft system. To efficiently design a hydrogen aircraft's TMS, we propose developing a novel design tool that will integrate TMS design with the design of the electrical power system and the cryogenic hydrogen storage system. This tool will serve as a framework upon which different sizing and  analysis tools, such as the in-house developed Electrical Power System   Sizing and Analysis Tool (EPSSAT) x , will be integrated to enable the iterative co-design of the TMS, power management and distribution (PMAD) system, and cryogenic system architectures. The flexibility enabled by this tool will allow for the quick sizing of components while also providing estimates on important performance parameters such as TMS mass, volume, area required, drag and power penalties for mid-size aircraft, which to the best of knowledge has not been done before. This tool will enable us to conduct a trade study on aircraft fuel cell systems operating in two different temperature regimes  under 100 oC and between 100 - 200 oC. These temperature ranges correspond to low temperature PEM, a more mature technology, and high temperature PEM, still in the development phase, fuel cell technology. The trade study will identify and evaluate various TMS architectures and interfaces, identify design drivers and technology gaps, and identify bounds and industry standards that will guide the TMS design. Our analysis will identify high priority test cases for each temperature range with a focus on system mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements. In addition, it will also be used to inform a more targeted investigation into more effective technologies for cooling large fuel cell stacks. Our team is proposing to investigate several enabling technologies that could benefit hydrogen fuel cell aircraft, such as  outer-mold line cooling enabled by oscillating heat pipes  using high-conductivity heat spreaders  using passive components like conventional heat pipes  using phase-change materials to handle transients  storing heat in the fuel, and using the product water from the fuel cell as a heat sink. The balance of plant components, including the cryogenic fuel storage and conditioning system, and the PMAD system will also be evaluated to provide a more realistic understanding of the TMS. 2. The milestones from this work result in a final deliverable of a TMS level design tool for low and high temperature PEM fuel cell hydrogen aircraft. We will deliver two completed TMS trade studies for fuel cells operating in the temperature ranges mentioned above. This will provide NASA with an understanding of what fuel cell operating temperature range is most promising with regard to the TMS and allow us to identify components that will require further development. These milestones are described in detail below  The first milestone will be to define the design space and to identify and gather standards that will guide the design of a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft TMS. We will identify and baseline a mission profile and identify a range of environmental conditions that a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft will experience under both nominal and off-nominal conditions. Major components and interfaces within the TMS will subsequently be identified, with operational limits defined to bound the design space.  Completed Month 2  The second milestone is to develop system-level models of the TMS, PMAD, and cryogenic storage systems for a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft. As a result of there being two different fuel cell ranges in this proposal, there will subsequently be two different TMS designed and evaluated to span the operational temperature ranges. It follows that each model will determine how heat is extracted and transported from each aircraft component, and then ultimately rejected to the surrounding air. Enabling technologies identified from our survey and other literature willsubsequently be subjected to the intense trade studies that follow from this design cycle. Ultimately, this will result in optimal configurations for each TMS. Both the PMAD and cryogenic models will be generated through collaboration with the CH2ARGE project, where efforts are already being made to design and interface these systems through existing tools such as EPS-SAT, which was created and used in other NASA aircraft projects.  Completed Month 9  The third milestone is to evaluate the two different TMS developed in milestone 2 and subject them to a baseline mission profile and nominal off nominal conditions and provide estimates on parameters important to a larger aircraft study. These parameters will include mass, parasitic power, and the TMS efficiency. A significant outcome of this effort will be the identification of design drivers and technology  gaps that must be addressed to make hydrogen aircraft feasible. Therefore, potential critical components will be identified and assigned performance requirements to be enabling technologies for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft.  Completed Month 12  3. There are many possible paths for follow-on research upon completion of this project. A major goal of this study is to identify technology gaps and uncertainties for fuel cell-based propulsion systems. This could include exploring different fuel cell materials and stack designs, deep dives into various TMS and components, detailed investigation of components within the cryogenic fluids management system, or the need to further explore innovative cycle architectures. Some potential next steps are described below  High Fidelity Modeling and Experimentation   experimental prototyping of promising technologies. This effort would involve a detailed investigation of critical components that require cooling. One example is the fuel cell as this is a limiting component that not only generates large amounts of heat, but also has difficulty in having this heat removed. Potential technologies from literature have pointed towards invasive technologies, such as heat pipes, to efficiently move this heat out  however, this is a multidisciplinary effort that would require collaboration with fuel cell experts to properly assess performance penalties. Resulting designs from a dedicated high-fidelity model would then logically move into a prototyping stage for eventual experimentation. Performance of additive heat exchangers at cryogenic temperatures - many of the advances in heat exchanger technology are made possible through additive manufacturing. However, there are very few studies into how the alloys used in additive manufacturing behave at cryogenic temperatures. The durability and life of these components is unknown and needs to be investigated. 4. While it is unlikely the actual approach to modeling the TMS will fail, it is possible that the designs won t be able to close due to mass, power, or volume constraints. In this situation we will move onto identifying technology gaps and placing bounds and requirements on enabling technologies. We will also identify testing that needs to be done on existing components to understand expected performance under the aircraft operating conditions.

Commoditization of molecular simulation data for exploration of new aerospace polymers,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Commoditization of molecular simulation data for exploration of new aerospace  polymers   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.       This work proposes to commoditize molecular polymer models by  (1) automating the development of models and their characterization data analysis and (2) developing standard methods allowing models to be compared more easily.       The materials available to design aircraft have a large impact on the capabilities of the aircraft and can be used to define the eras of flight   wood and canvas, aluminum, titanium, fiber reinforced polymer, etc. Traditionally, new materials development is a long-lead and expensive part of new aircraft design. The advent of computational modeling new materials has the potential to advance the efficiency of new material development to accelerate the insertion of new materials to meet challenging aviation goals. For example, non-petroleum derived polymers, polymers for lightweight composites, and low-energy curing polymers can decrease the environmental impact of an aircraft lifecycle.      For state-of-the-art fiber reinforced composite systems, the axial properties are dominated by the fiber, and the purpose of the polymer is to facilitate load transfer between fibers. Properties that depend on this load transfer and therefore on the polymer include fracture toughness, transverse, and shear properties. Improving these properties can reduce the weight of the structure or new non-petroleum-based polymers could be used if their performance can match those of existing polymers.      The problem we are proposing to address is the speed and cost of modeling new polymer materials. Many relevant properties of polymer materials originate from the molecular structure of the polymer and can be predicted using molecular dynamics simulation. However, molecular dynamics models can be time consuming to build and develop, which typically limits in-depth analysis to single polymer systems. Developing new polymers, however, requires screening of many different candidate systems. The individually customized modeling procedures currently in use have costs (time and effort) beyond what is required to generate a large database of properties or to rapidly screen new chemistries. Furthermore, machine learning and other emerging data analysis methods are predicated on the availability of large quantities of reasonably curated data.       There are commercial packages with polymer modeling capabilities, such as the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, Materials Square, and Materials Studio. These are typically wrappers that use the capabilities of open-source molecular dynamics codes and their engine. Often the focus of these commercial packages is  democratizing  molecular models, so the emphasis is on a graphical user interface. The goal of this project though, is to involve as little or no human intervention. Some packages have scripting capabilities, but the user would be required to write the software that performs the automation negating the benefits of the commercial package.      One of the requirements of developing a database of simulation material properties is a set of standardized procedures used to create the polymers and characterize them. For experimental materials, there are standards such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) that allow for comparison of material properties. For molecular models, research groups tend to have their own methods, which vary in ways that may or may not be consequential. To overcome the challenge of standard and repeatable results of molecular models of polymers, what is being proposed is method development to establish standard procedures for computationally guided selection of material properties.      To these ends we are proposing  (1) automation of the generation of molecular models of polymer systems and the characterization of the resulting systems, such that new systems can be rapidly screened and (2) standardization (versioning) of molecular simulation procedures, so the resulting predictions are repeatable and comparable.          Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.      Milestone 1  Determination of modeling procedures and system sizes for select material properties.   Outcomes  Baseline standards for select material properties. Select properties are expected to include crosslink density, mass density, glass transition temperature, Young s modulus, and may be expanded to include area-under-the-curve toughness, yield strength and other molecular-scale properties. Preliminary polymer systems would include well characterized systems such as epoxy-amine systems and homopolymerized epoxy systems, which are used to validate the procedures and work through the automation steps.       Milestone 2  Estimate compute resources required to generate specific database sizes, based on system size and runtime requirements obtained from milestone 1.   Outcomes  Estimate the average system sizes required and simulation runtimes required to obtain the select properties from Milestone 1. This data is used to determine database sizes that can be modeled (0.1K, 1K, 10K polymers etc.).      Milestone 3  Identification of workflow steps that require automation and document software requirements for each step.   Outcomes  A roadmap of the software requirements that need to be developed. For example  what would be involved in automating the assignment of some popular molecular force fields, what would be required to automate the polymerization reaction chemistry definitions   which are required to build the models from their constituent monomers, automatic data analysis of the resulting models to determine the material properties, which currently involves some human intervention.       Upon completion of the milestones the software requirements and compute resources to generate a database of material properties will be known.      After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    After completion of these milestones, the work may proceed to developing the software to automate the simulation workflows and generate a database of properties. Some automation has already been performed under the Hi-Rate Composite Aircraft Manufacturing (HiCAM) and Game Changing Development (GCD) super-lightweight aerospace composites (SAC) projects, which resulted in databases for rapid curing resins and ionic liquid resins, respectively, on the order of tens of polymer systems being developed with reduced human intervention. Through this work it became apparent that there was a plausible path to fully automate the workflow.   The suite of material properties that are predicted can also be expanded. As the standardized procedures mature and the database grows, data analysis can be performed on the data to identify potential polymers for new environmentally friendly aircraft structures. Multi-scale models that use the molecular dynamics models as input could be built to predict properties that originate at length-scales larger than is possible with molecular dynamics, like fracture toughness. The scope could also be expanded to include investigating requirements for high throughput experimental screening of polymer systems, including identification of chokepoints and estimation of resources required to generate experimental databases of various sizes. The experimental data may also overlap with the simulation data to aid in model validation.       Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    If the compute resources required to generate a full database are beyond reason, methods to reduce the computational cost can be explored. For example, coarse-grain simulations could be developed. This adds complexity and development costs but could reduce compute resources. ",,,,,,
Elastocaloric Cooling  The Missing Link in Green Aviation,TTT Green Aviation,,"Transformational Tools   Technologies Project FY24 Green Aviation Proposal 1 Title  Elastocaloric Cooling  The Missing Link in Green Aviation 1. Project Description, Background, and Motivation  Elastocaloric materials are currently poised to serve as transformative and efficient solid-state coolants relevant to TX14 Thermal Management Systems (TX14.2.1 Heat Acquisition and TX14.2.2 Heat transport) in the 2020 NASA Technology Taxonomy  1  but they have yet to be considered as a major enabling element for Green Aviation. This year (2023), NASA s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (AMRD) has published a strategic plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050, whereby hydrogen fuel and other electronic power sources (batteries) are major contenders to replace carbon-rich fossil fuels. To reach the objective of zero carbon emissions, several milestones must be reached on a global scale including sourcing and transporting elemental hydrogen, developing hydrogen combustion systems which burn hotter than fossil-fuels in traditional Brayton cycles  2 , implementing temperature sensitive high-efficiency batteries, and replacing electronics that exhibit losses from joule heating  3 . Phase change materials (PCMs), such as paraffin wax and heat pipes, have been implemented in prior studies to overcome these problems, yet their performance relies on specific ambient conditions and an optimal geometric design for specific duty cycles. Thermal buffering is not robust enough to keep pace with NASA s decarbonization efforts. One major limiting factor common to all these proposed carbon-free technologies (including nuclear) is the peak operating temperature. Therefore, thermal control is of paramount importance to support the development of Green Aviation. Current cooling methods rely heavily on vapor-compression technology, whereby, the latent heat of vaporization of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) produces the cooling effect with which we are familiar. In vapor form, these HFCs are greenhouse gases, and therefore cannot support the cooling of Green Aviation systems. Accidental release of HFCs during the filling or catastrophic bursting of over-pressured refrigerant lines is a major worldwide problem that contributes to global warming. Therefore, several agencies and countries have supported the development of high-efficiency refrigeration technology free of HFCs  4 . Elastocaloric materials offer a carbon-neutral solution to replacing HFCs and vapor-compression refrigerators. In its simplest description, the elastocaloric effect (ECE) is defined as the temperature change that occurs within a material when it is elastically deformed by a mechanical load. Thermodynamically, all materials exhibit this behavior, but some, namely shape memory alloys (SMAs), are capable of super-elastocaloric effects. These super-ECEs are characterized by adiabatic temperature changes,        , of over 20 C and manifest from the latent heat of reversible martensitic phase transformations  5  driven during superelasticity. Fortunately, SMAs are under current investigation at NASA for aeronautical actuation, e.g., in vortex generators and aileron motion. Several of their properties have been measured and stored in databases, and a unique feature of SMAs is their 2-way thermomechanical coupling which enables their value as coolants. SMAs are energy converters and are the archetypal candidates for super-ECE cooling systems  6 . In SMAs, reversible martensitic transformations are driven by mechanical stress,   , temperature (  ) sweeps, and sometimes a magnetic field,   . If the transition takes place under a constant   , a large shape change can be observed as indicated by the alloy s strain,    (superelasticity).   -driven changes in heat capacity,     , serve as the backbone of the ECE, and in SMAs the latent heat of the reversible martensitic phase transformation superimposes with the traditional ECE. Fig. 1(a) demonstrates the large         measured in a NiCoMnTi SMA which was measured to be    18 C  7 . Recently, researchers in academia and industry are pushing to exploit super-elastocaloric technology, but they often rely on bulky tension compression instrumentation. The coefficient of performance (COP) is determined based on both material properties and loading type, as shown in Fig. 1b. In Fig. 1b, SMAs subscripted with a  t  or  c  indicate tensile or compressive loading.  Transformational Tools   Technologies Project FY24 Green Aviation Proposal 2 The PI believes that torsion may offer a better excitation mode whereby the mechanical advantage of gears can be exploited to decrease the power needed to produce the desired        . Torsion designs could enable the miniaturization of the excitation system and minimization of necessary power input. This project focuses investigations in the  unknown  region labeled in Fig. 1b for materials with COPs greater than 23 and         greater than 20 C  6 . The development of miniature solid-state regenerators could revolutionize Green Aviation by enabling better temperature control in zero-carbon emission systems. (a) (b) Fig. 1  (a) The stress-driven adiabatic temperature change,        , in NiCoMnTi shape memory alloys reported in Ref.  7 , and (b) the         corresponding to the ECE in commonly studied SMAs  6 . 2. Plan and Anticipated Milestones  The ECE is usually defined by the         or isothermal entropy change,    (    ,   )   1           (       1      0        )    , where    is mass density,      1 and      are test temperatures,      1     ,         (     1       ) and        (     1       ) 2  8 . The     is useful in determining the COP  8  shown in Fig. 1b, and prior work has demonstrated that the COP of SMAs can be approximated by seven materials properties, namely the transformation strain,        , the reverse-transformation Clausius-Clapeyron slopes (slope of phase diagram co-existence lines),             and            , the austenite finish temperature,     , the martensite start and finish temperatures,      and      respectively, and the      of martensite. Some of these parameters have already been measured in several SMAs at NASA Glenn Research Center and the PI aims to perform bulk data analysis to identify promising compositions for ECE applications. If funded, this project (Table 1) will result in at least one technical memorandum or journal article in the first year and a path to design 2 novel SMAs. This project is defined by the 3 tasks listed below  1. Review databased super-ECE data and the state-of-the-art with an emphasis in identifying important and missing materials properties and determine if a COP above 25 is feasible with          20 C in SMAs. 2. Down select and assess both archetypal and novel binary ternary SMA systems through common synthesis and processing techniques (arc-melting vacuum annealing), and characterize properties at least via calorimetry (latent heat,     ). The measurement of other characteristics such as (    ,   ,    ,          ) with isothermal mechanical testing, and iso-stress heating cooling experiments will be attempted and potentially pursued with follow-on funding. Mechanical testing and calorimetry will also be used to determine hysteresis loss. 3. Perform application pathfinding and speculate on potential areas in Green Aviation that would benefit from miniature high-efficiency carbon-neutral cooling systems.

Sustaining research beyond the award period  The ECE is not specific to SMAs but is a thermodynamic feature of all physical matter. Moreover, the caloric effects in matter are not limited to mechanically driven temperature changes. Instead, different driving forces can be applied, including electric and magnetic fields to change temperatures in electrocaloric and magnetocaloric effects (MCE), respectively. The ECE via tension and compression is only one potential solution in solid-state cooling to support Green Aviation. Torsional modes should also be investigated. Therefore, follow-up research and transition areas include studying other non-SMA calorific materials, the MCE, and various loading modes. Specifically, the giant MCE has been under scrupulous investigation in meta-magnetic shape memory alloys over the past few decades  8 . Additionally, this work can benefit NASA space missions, including the space technology research grants, early state Innovations (ESI) and ARTEMIS by providing a method of extreme thermal management. Other applications can include passive cooling of all electric aircraft motors. 4. Risk Mitigation  In the hypothetical situation that my team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible, we will pivot by designing materials to overcome the obstacle. For example, if some SMAs do not exhibit the necessary mechanical properties for several thousand cycles of super-ECE loading, we will attempt to understand why and design a material with the needed properties (strength, ductility, microstructure, etc.). The proposed project is low-risk and has the potential for a high-yielding transformative technology to support Green Aviation. 5. References  1.

Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing for Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing for Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.       We are proposing an unconventional compound backward-forward swept wing concept as shown.              Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing Design      The premise of this proposed concept is the potential gain in aerodynamic efficiency which could lead to reduced energy consumption  1 . This could be due to the increased lift as a result of the aeroelastic wash-in twist due to wing bending. This bending-induced lift is given by  2    Text  Description automatically generated   where w is the vertical bending, y is the conventional pitch axis coordinate, and L is the elastic axis sweep angle, negative for forward-swept wing. The flow on the outboard forward swept wing is generally directed inward while the flow on the inboard backward swept wing is generally directed outward  1 . In the transition region, it is hypothesized that the flow would be largely streamwise, resulting in additional increased lift. The inward spanwise flow outboard tends to decrease the wing tip vortices, hence reducing the induced drag  1 . Appropriate geometric twist design can be incorporated to further reduce the wing tip vortices.      Forward swept wing design has been tested on X-29 aircraft  3 . Advantages and disadvantages are well-documented  1 . Improved aerodynamic efficiency and high-angle-of-attack performance are known advantages of forward-swept wing design  1 . Stability and aeroelasticity (bending divergence) are known challenges with forward swept wing design which are generally viewed as major technical barriers  2,3 . A compound backward-forward swept wing could potentially be a transformative design since very little research has been done on this type of wing design. It is believed that the proposed concept would lessen these issues due to the inboard backward swept wing which would compensate for the adverse effects of the outboard forward swept wing, while potentially providing increased aerodynamic efficiency.       1  https   www.ae.utexas.edu courses ase333t past projects 04spring  FSW 20Airfoils 20Inc fsw.htm, Date of Retrieval  October 13, 2023    2  Bisplinghoff, R., Ashley, H., and Halfman, R., Aeroelasticity, Dover Publication, 1996, pp. 481-483    3  Putnam, T. W., X-29 Flight Research Program, AIAA 2nd Flight Test Conference, AIAA-1983-2687, November 1983      Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.      A tentative set of milestones are as follows       Month 1 - OML and structural model definition of a conventional backward swept wing and a few proposed wing with varying transition station and forward sweep angle for comparison   Month 4 - Aero-structural performance tradeoff analysis to identify an aerodynamic efficient design using VSPAERO coupled to transonic small disturbance integral boundary layer and finite-element model.   Month 6 - CFD verification in FUN3D aeroelastic solver and comparison high-angle-of-attack performance of clean wing between the conventional and proposed design.   Month 8 - Aeroelasticity and stability analysis in VSPAERO coupled to TSD IBL and NASTRAN   Month 10 - Verification of aeroelasticity and stability in FUN3D aeroelastic solver using forced oscillation simulation data   Month 12 - Final report submission      The metrics for evaluating the proposed work will assess improved L D for the same structural weight and stability and aeroelasticity criteria which could be static pitch stability, bending-torsion divergence speed, or other criteria. Success criteria will be defined.      After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?       If successful, the immediate next step would involve identifying a potential project (TTT, AATT) for transition and briefing to industry collaborators (e.g., Boeing).  The follow-on research would include  low-speed wind tunnel test at university facility (e.g. University of Washington), full aircraft configuration aerodynamic performance analysis, control surface modeling, FUN3D stability and control (S C) simulation and analysis of full configuration, addressing design complexity and weight-drag tradeoff, high-lift design and performance, and aeroelastic tool development for rapid performance and S C analysis of proposed concepts.      Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    One potential scenario of pivoting from the initial proposed approach is to explore alternative approaches. The initial phase of work will involve performing design trade study between aerodynamics, stability, and aeroelasticity. This study may define alternative approaches in addition to initial preferred concepts. One alternative approach could be an actively controlled forward-swept wing tip design to provide limited L D benefit and improved stall characteristics of the aileron in low-speed operations. Alternative concepts of passive stability augmentation could also be explored by modifying the design of the tail stabilator including the location. Another alternative approach could closely examine the role of structural interaction whereby aero-structural optimization would be performed to better reveal the potential benefit of the compound backward-forward-swept wing design. It is anticipated that further refinement of preferred concepts and alternative approaches could well take up a full year. ",,,,,,
Integrating Bio-inspired Multifunctional Structures into QUiet Electric Engines (QUEEN),TTT Green Aviation,,"The electrification of engines for large single-aisle aircraft ( 180 passengers) and integration of these engines onto novel airframes, such as the Subsonic Aft Engine (SUSAN) concept aircraft is a formidable challenge. To realize predicted performance benefits, these engines are more tightly integrated into the fuselages than in the past which implies more cooperation between engine and airframe manufacturers. New design and optimization tools are needed, as well as the data to validate these tools.  New aircraft will need to prove flightworthiness, and certification requirements are not yet established for these new configurations, posing financial and technical risks to manufacturers. Since there are international regulations on aircraft noise and emissions, formulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) Working Group and adopted by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, cleaner and quieter aircraft have a competitive advantage in the global market.    How will a large electric aircraft take-off and land safely, cleanly, and quietly on a hot windy day or a cold snowy day?  Heat exchangers and acoustic absorbers will be need co-located inside the fan duct.  Heat exchangers will be needed to keep the motors and controllers cool or to prevent ice from accumulating in the inlet.  Acoustic absorbers are needed to reduce the noise produced by the fan and motor before it can propagate to the cabin and pollute the environment.  While aircraft engine acoustic liners and inlet anti-icing systems are already packaged into today s turbofan engine inlets, new heat exchangers that will be part of the electric aircraft thermal management system must now be added.     Traditionally, several components (e.g. rotor, guide vanes, nacelle, liners, heat exchangers) are built separately and assembled modularly. The function of each component is considered separately, and it becomes difficult to optimize the entire system, especially if acoustics and low-noise features are not included early in the component design.  Multifunctional structures to transfer heat and absorb sound, however, offer the promise of reduced weight and improved system performance.  Integrating the acoustic liner into the entire build of a ducted electrofan as a unit is an approach that has not been attempted before.  By using rapid prototyping techniques, the entire assembly can be built as a unit allowing even traditional acoustic technologies to be blended across the engine build. There are several potential benefits to this approach.  First, the total acoustic liner length could be increased which could help reduce noise emissions, especially for engines with short inlets.  Second, when multifunctional structures are tightly integrated into the ducted electrofans, we might be able to avoid seams and steps in the liner that are common problems with traditional liners.  Discontinuities in the acoustic liners can be a source of noise, and eliminating or reducing these discontinuities could improve liner performance and reduce aircraft engine noise pollution.   NASA s patented bio-inspired Broadband Acoustic Absorber (aka  bioliner ) has utilized additive manufacturing to rapidly prototype bioliner segments for proof-of-concept experiments.  Data from these experiments demonstrate that structures that resemble bundles of natural reeds can absorb sound over a wide frequency range (400 Hz to 3000Hz), and better than state-of-the-art for frequencies between 400 Hz to 1000 Hz. Thin, lightweight, and durable acoustic absorbers effective over a wide frequency range especially for low frequency sounds below 1000 Hz are needed for a broad range of aerospace, industrial, marine, and architectural noise control applications.  Maturation of the bioliner technology can easily be incorporated into the QUEEN development spirals.    Since the Quiet Electric Engines being designed for the Subsonic Single Aft Engine (QUEEN) 25  Flight Research Vehicle will need to incorporate a heat exchanger that competes for volume within the nacelle that is also needed by the acoustic liner, multifunctional structures that can transfer heat and absorb sound are required.  The bioliner is one promising candidate for this test bed.  Bench tests of multifunctional structures will be needed to develop thermal and acoustic models so that these multifunctional structures can be optimized in the fan integration. Of vital importance to this compatibly is the bioliner team developing a model for design methodology. This is a necessary requirement to effectively mature the bioliner technology. However, early QUEEN prototypes can provide validation data sets for those models and essential design and manufacturability information.  ",,,,,,
Durability of Cryotanks for Aircraft via Flow-forming Technology (DuraCrAFT),TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Durability of Cryotanks for Aircraft via Flow-forming Technology (DuraCrAFT)   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and benefits).     Problem   The National Climate Action Plan for Aviation aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. One solution is the maturation of hydrogen-powered aircraft to achieve zero-emission flight. Given the urgency to meet carbon emission reduction targets, a reliable solution to storage of cryofuels is needed. The design and fabrication of cryotanks suitable for commercial aviation present numerous challenges in containing high-pressures (300 bar) at low temperatures (as low as 20 K) while delivering a lightweight, reliable solution. This proposal aims to utilize flow forming, a high-rate, low-cost metal forming process, to adapt the aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) tank design used for spaceflight hardware into unitized Al-Li tank structures that are weight-competitive with composites.      Al-Li cryotanks have been used in space flight (e.g. external tanks) or developmental hydrogen-powered cars   1  , however both applications have different requirements than aviation. Cryotanks for space flight, even the reusable versions, do not need to sustain thousands of thermal and pressurization cycles, while automotive cryotanks have more similar lifecycles, though do not need to focus on a lightweight design   2  . Airbus and Universal Hydrogen are reportedly preparing metallic cryotanks for use in hydrogen-powered aircraft, however there is no report of utilizing unitized (less weld length resulting in less leaks) and integrally stiffened (better performance) structures enabled by flow forming   3  . Unitized and integrally stiffened tanks fabricated from Al-Li may offer greater reliability and durability than both conventional metallic and composite designs to sustain the many pressure and temperature cycles of flight and refueling, as well as more easily meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, such as crashworthiness and inspectability. Additionally, the high costs of composite cryotanks are acceptable for high-budget spaceflight applications. However, for the near-term need of sustainable aviation, the cost of composite cryotanks for aircraft may be prohibitive   4  .       While flow forming offers beneficial weight and rate savings over conventional manufacturing, there are still open questions regarding the durability of flow-formed cryotanks for aircraft applications. Flow forming imparts significant coldworking (and potential residual stresses), which raises concerns for the crack initiation and propagation performance over thousands of thermal and pressurization cycles. Additionally, hydrogen embrittlement is a concern for aluminum cryotanks, especially if cracks are introduced.      Approach   The conventional metallic cryotank fabrication approach utilizes welding to piece together dozens of panels to form a tank. However, forming has been shown to reduce weight by 5-8  in large-scale domes and tanks by eliminating a significant fraction of welds through unitization   5  . Additionally, since leaks tend to occur at welded joints rather than acreage, the reduction of the total weld length should create a less permeable structure. The integrally stiffened cryotank serves as a further improvement over the state of the art by reducing the number of secondary reinforcement structures needed. Flow forming a cryotank for aircraft has not been attempted likely due to the limited number of research-grade advanced forming equipment available. The durability of flow-formed cryotanks is largely unknown and must be understood in order mature this technology, thus starting with fatigue testing and residual stress measurements is a logical first step.      Impact   This proposal aims to survey and elucidate the not-well-understood durability of flow-formed structures for long-life aircraft applications, specifically targeting the crack initiation behavior of flow-formed parts under cyclical loading. Tayon et al.   6   have shown improved toughness in flow formed aluminum 6061 as compared to wrought plate, however other durability issues such as fatigue strength and crack propagation are unexplored. Instead of relying on a build and test strategy to demonstrate durability, this proposal sets the stage by collecting data needed to develop predictive models. The predictive capabilities should reduce the need for excessive characterization and testing as cryotank (and future structure) designs change. Coupling a finite element model (DEFORM) that predicts microstructure and a crack formation and propagation model allows for intelligent, efficient process optimization instead of lengthy empirical approaches. If successful, this proposal could result in a pathway to a reliable, cost-effective, manufacturable metallic cryotank capable of meeting net-zero carbon aviation goals. Secondly, the capability of predicting flow-formed microstructures and mechanical properties can be leveraged for efficient design and production of other flow-formed aerospace structures such as fuselages, nacelles, nozzles, and nose cones.      Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   This proposal for assessing the durability of flow-formed articles for aircraft cryotanks culminates in the following milestones    Mechanical test data (at cryo-temperatures), focusing on fatigue testing, using existing integrally stiffened aluminum 2195 flow-formed parts. This data will be benchmarked against handbook values or experimental data generated by testing on rolled plate with the same geometry. (1-9 months)   Characterization of the microstructure, which will be guided by the microstructural factors that are known to influence crack initiation, with special attention to the microstructural statistics needed for modeling durability behaviors. (1-9 months)    Discovery phase which will assess durability properties that have the greatest impact on the performance of a metallic cryotank based on available research to guide the next phase of testing. (9-11 months)   Final report summarizing the findings and suggesting future work. (11-12 months)   The characterization effort should be assessed by the ability for the microstructural data to be inputted into a model to predict the mechanical behavior in question and sufficient data to demonstrate the fatigue life of flow-formed parts (with reduced residual stresses). The discovery phase should be evaluated on the evidence that supports a suggested testing plan in the next phase.   After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps transition follow-on research?    This proposal aims to set the direction and foundation for developing a viable and reliable metallic cryotank to enable net-zero carbon flight. The next steps are to pursue modeling of durability and microstructure of flow formed structures  testing  structural design and optimization  and manufacturing demonstrators. The question of reliability will be addressed in part by a two-pronged modeling effort. The first is to expand upon current finite element capabilities using DEFORM to predict microstructures of flow formed parts. The second is to use the microstructural and mechanical property data from this work to validate a model and predict durability of flow-formed structures, potentially collaborating with the crack initiation modeling team in TTT. Commensurate experimental parts will be flow formed on NASA LaRC s VUD-600 vertical forming machine and characterized to add further data to the model. Full-cylinder fatigue testing (and other durability tests like crack propagation) will be pursued to assess in the influence of residual stresses.    The actual design and fabrication of the cryotak also requires attention. A structural optimization study will work on designing the cryotank with input from the mechanical testing results as well as with consideration of FAA certification requirements, such as crashworthiness and inspectability. Additional input would be sought from Vadim Lvovich at Glenn Research Center who is leading a project focusing on hydrogen-powered aircraft propulsion.    From the proposed design, a sub-scale demonstration article can be flow-formed, which is envisioned to be formed in two parts. A unitized dome and cylinder (spin and flow formed) would be friction stir welded to a second spin-formed dome. The sub-scale demonstrator would be tested for durability using an existing cylinder pressure tester capable of cyclical testing up to 5000 psi. The current proposal and these next steps will answer key questions about the durability of integrally stiffened flow formed cryotanks for adoption by the green aviation industry.   Address the following hypothetical scenario from your perspective as PI  work not feasible?    Flow forming offers numerous benefits, including a high manufacturing rate, the ability to fabricate thin, integrally stiffened cylinders (and domes), and cost-effectiveness, thus if the fatigue life is determined to be a showstopper, the issue would be remedied on a material and structural level. On the material level, focusing on understanding the underlying mechanism causing poor performance could give direction on how to mitigate the issue. Some potential options are to perform thermomechanical processing to relieve residual stress or change the underlying microstructure to achieve better performance. If that proves unsuccessful, fabricating parts out of a different alloy using the VUD-600 to achieve adequate properties or from existing extruded integrally stiffened 2195 panels would be pursued. A structural design, possibly including additional secondary structures, could be pursued to further increase the fatigue life. A short trade study would follow to understand the impact from the proposed changes on the weight, volume, manufacturability, and performance of the cryotank.     1.

Stator core material development for next generation electric motors,TTT Green Aviation,,"FY24 Green Aviation Proposal (TTT) Title  Stator core material development for next generation electric motors 1. Work Description What problem are you solving? NASA identifies Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) as a leading strategy to reduce fuel usage and CO2 emissions associated with aviation. Across the competing EAP system topologies, common power density targets have been identified for electric motors ( 10 kW kg) and the associated power electronics ( 20 kW kg) to enable closed designs and compete with existing turbine power densities ( 13 kW kg)  1 . Significant research is focused on the development and demonstration of subsystems and systems that meet the difficult requirements for this application. The current state of the art for aviation rated electric motors is assessed to be 5-7 kW kg  2 , approximately half the target value. This proposal targets improvement in the magnetic material used in electric motor stators to achieve the targeted power density. Power in a motor is given as          , where    is the torque and    is the rotational speed. Strategies to increase motor power density seek to increase these parameters. Torque is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field between the rotor and stator (airgap flux density), and the radius Maxwell force. Large radii are not preferred for aviation applications due to drag and volume considerations, so that large flux densities are preferred to increase torque. High performance motors typically use FeCo alloys that have saturation flux densities near        2.4 T, the highest value of any known bulk industrial material. No known pathways exist to develop bulk ferromagnetic materials with higher flux densities, but superconducting machines offer a possible solution if the necessary cryogenic conditions can be maintained. The rotational speed of aviation propulsion motors is typically 2-3 krpm, limited by tip speed for direct drive connections. Faster motor speeds may be possible with the addition of reduction gearing, that is common in many aircraft applications and has a relatively low impact to the total power density  3 . Other possibilities exist for direct drive use of high-speed motors or engine driven generators that operate near turbine speeds (15-20 krpm). High power motors in this speed range are common for terrestrial applications such as gas compression or fly wheel storage but no demonstrations exist for MW-scale high speed aviation motors 4 . Motor components that produce AC flux (soft magnetic materials and windings) produce heat proportional to the electrical frequency, and thermal management limits the maximum speed a motor can achieve. Improved thermal systems, high temperature materials, and different motor topologies can mitigate these effects but improved magnetic materials that can operate efficiently at high frequency without excess heat production enable power density improvements without contributing to the thermal problem. Given the lack of a research path toward improving torque, we identify the increase of motor speed as the most likely path to achieve the required  2X improvement in non-superconducting aircraft electric motor power density. Many different motor topologies exist, with brushless DC permanent magnet motors currently showing the highest power densities along with promising results from switched reluctance designs that require more complex controls. This can be attributed to the lack of rotor windings and mainly DC rotor flux that does not generate frequency related heat in these topologies. The stator and stator windings of these designs produce the required AC flux and we target the stator for improvement. Due to the variations in motor design, we propose the development of a motor stator capable of flux densities near the current state of the art ( 1.5 T) with power losses at high frequency ( 2 kHz) less than those produced in current materials at 1 kHz. This sets a performance target and motivates the development of a low loss, high saturation induction magnetic material and a manufacturing process to package this material into a suitable stator. Has this been tried before? Why why not? Losses in laminated metallic soft magnetic materials have two components  those that are dependent or independent of the excitation frequency. The frequency dependent components are mostly related to eddy currents that are inversely proportional to the lamination. Recent commercial efforts successfully reduced motor stack lamination thickness in bulk crystalline FeCo alloys(Hiperco, Vacoflux, etc ) down to 50  m  5,6 , resulted in a 2X reduction in losses compared to previous lamination thicknesses (Figure 1 left). The measured core loss of  50 W kg at 1 kHz is the upper limit of thermal load for a conventional motor design. Therefore, thinner laminations allow for higher excitation frequency for the same thermal load. While this is a significant improvement, the frequency independent component of losses in bulk crystalline alloys are high due to the large grain size and significant magnetostriction. No bulk crystalline materials with saturation induction Bs 1.5 T and zero magnetostriction are currently known. Figure 1  Comparison of core losses (W kg) vs induction (T) in a bulk crystalline FeCo alloy with 50 m thick laminations to a similar alloy with 6mil (150 m) laminations at 1kHz (left) and a FeSi-based nanocomposite at 5kHz (right). We propose improvements to stator performance beyond what is possible in bulk crystalline stator materials with grain size typically  10  m. Nanocomposite soft magnetic materials produced from rapidly solidified amorphous ribbon can have significantly lower losses compared to thin crystalline FeCo motor alloys (Figure 1 right). This is due to the small grain size (20ppm) or FeSi-based nanocomposites with low saturation induction (10 W kg. 2. Milestones The concept described above, through the final demonstration of low losses in a packaged stator, represents a development effort greater than 1 year. The proposed work for this project seeks to assess feasibility and demonstrate a proof of concept    3mo - Identify research paths to produce nanocomposite alloys with Bs 1.5 T and low magnetostriction   s 1.5 T and   s ",,,,,,
Optimization of High Voltage Cables for Electrified Propulsion,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   Title  Optimization of High Voltage Cables for Electrified Propulsion   1. Development and implementation of electrified propulsion systems are a key component to achieving the green aviation targets laid out in the ARMD Strategic Implementation Plan. Electrified propulsion requires achieving high energy densities, either through improved energy storage technologies or reduced weight of aircraft components. Regarding the latter, electrified propulsion is expected to lead to an increase in the required electrical wiring. Therefore, developing lightweight, high voltage, i.e., for high power, cables is desirable. Cables consist of an inner electrical conductor surrounded by insulating material.  Both conductor and insulation materials require optimization.  Here we focus on the inner conductor.  Recently, a study from Glenn Research Center by Almansour et al.  1  investigated the possibility of replacing pure copper (Cu) conductors with Cu-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) composites. They found, through a trial-and-error process of testing different fabrication techniques and composite compositions, that it was possible to increase electrical conductivity by 4.8  compared to traditional Cu cables. As a result, these Cu CNT composite cables, able to deliver the same amount of power as state-of-the-art Cu cables, offered a 13.5  weight reduction. Despite this success, the properties of different Cu CNT samples were inconsistent due to difficulty in achieving a uniform Cu coating on the CNTs (Figure 1). Nonuniform Cu coatings also made the cables more susceptible to failure when placed under stress. A better understanding of the basic Cu deposition processes underlying Cu CNT fabrication would undoubtedly help to optimize the process and produce cables with consistently improved properties. Using physics-based modeling, this work aims to provide strategies for how uniform Cu coatings can be deposited onto CNTs. Optimized Cu CNT fabrication should be able to produce cables with  20  weight reduction compared to state-of-the-art Cu cables.      Figure 1  Examples of nonuniform Cu coatings on CNTs from  1 .   We plan to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study how Cu atoms attach to the Cu-CNT interfaces. MD simulations are a technique which allows for the tracking of the motion of individual atoms in a system using a parametrized interatomic potential (force field) model. Cu deposition is an atomic scale process which is well-suited to study with this technique. MD simulations have been utilized extensively to study the mechanical behavior of composites composed of Cu and different carbon allotropes  2,3  as well as the growth of graphene on Cu surfaces (Figure 2)  4,5 . Therefore, there are several existing interatomic potential models which can be utilized to perform new MD simulations of the Cu coating process. The atomic scale resolution of MD simulations will provide insights into the fabrication of Cu CNT composites previously inaccessible to experimental techniques.   We expect that the curvature resulting from the CNT radius will affect Cu deposition. Therefore, an initial series of MD simulations will be performed with a flat sheet of graphene (an unrolled CNT) to serve as a comparison and testbed for different simulation conditions. The Cu deposition will be performed at several different rates and temperatures to determine how this affects formation of the Cu layer. Deposition parameters favoring the formation of a uniform Cu coating will be carried over into subsequent simulations. Additionally, graphene, and as a result CNTs, are known to possess several structural defects  6 , including vacancies, adatoms, and dislocations, which could serve as preferential sites for Cu attachment. Deposition simulations of Cu in the presence of structural defects will indicate if such  nucleation sites  favor the formation of nonuniform coatings and would thereby be detrimental to Cu CNT composite fabrication.   The second series of simulations will focus directly on CNTs. Depending on how the carbon atoms are connected, CNTs can have two different conformations ( armchair  and  zigzag ) in addition to having variable radii. Indeed, in the study done by Almansour et al.  1  the CNTs were not characterized   effectively random CNT characteristics could have contributed to the inconsistency in Cu CNT composite properties. Therefore, MD simulations will be performed to deposit Cu atoms on CNTs of varying characteristics and elucidate how this may impact the quality of the resulting Cu coating. These MD simulations will provide strategic insight into how the Cu deposition process can be tuned to produce Cu CNT composites with a desirable uniform Cu coating. This will enable dramatically more consistent fabrication of Cu CNT cables which offer significant weight savings over existing Cu cables for application in electrified propulsion systems.   2. This work will be divided into the following milestones    Q1  Evaluation and selection of an appropriate interatomic potential model   Q1-Q2  MD simulations of Cu deposition on graphene   Q3-Q4  MD simulations of Cu deposition on CNTs.   The following success criteria will be used to evaluate this work    Cu deposition parameters which favor uniform coating are determined.   Structural defects detrimental to uniform Cu deposition are identified.   Trends in CNT characteristics best suited for uniform Cu coatings are determined.   3. After the completion of this work, the insights gained from MD simulations into the Cu coating process should be directly applied to Cu CNT composite fabrication, e.g., optimal deposition parameters and selection of CNTs with favorable characteristics. Electrical conductivity measurements will allow for the weight savings due to Cu CNT cables to be determined. Follow-on research should focus on applying quantum mechanics-based calculations to determine the electrical conductivity of CNTs with Cu attached at different sites. These types of calculations using density functional theory (DFT) have been well-established  7  and would provide further insight, beyond the capabilities of MD simulations, into which CNTs offer superior properties for Cu CNT cables.   4. The reliability of the MD simulation depends on the quality of employed interatomic potential model. If we find that Cu-C interatomic potentials available in literature are not good enough for our study the research will pivot to the development of a new interatomic potential model for the Cu-CNT system. The development of a new model could be beneficial for studying multi-metal deposition onto CNTs. The inclusion of some carbide-forming metals such as Fe and Ni can result in improved bonding at the Cu-CNT interface  8 , making this an alternative strategy to fabricating reliable Cu CNT composites. Once the potential is developed, we will come back to the research plan described above.    References    1  A. Almansour, D. Sacksteder, A.J. Goretski III, and M.

Integration of hydrogen fuel tanks in aircraft design - volume study,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Integration of hydrogen fuel tanks in aircraft design - volume study   The objective of the study is to review the vehicle configuration and structural design issues related to the integration of fuel tanks for storage of liquid or gaseous hydrogen into novel forms of aircraft design. The motivation for this study is that efficient hydrogen storage is a key enabling technology for the advancement of sustainable aviation applications, including hydrogen-powered conventional aviation concepts as well as the design of revolutionary environmentally friendly vehicles.    Compared to jet fuel, hydrogen has a gravimetric density that is 2.8 times higher than jet fuel. However, even in a liquid state (LH2), hydrogen has a 4.1 times lower volumetric density than jet fuel. Taken together, this this means LH2 requires larger tanks that must be maintained at cryogenic temperatures, even though hydrogen has 2.8 times more energy per kilogram than jet fuel. Compared to liquid hydrogen, gaseous hydrogen (GH2) needs to be compressed and, for conventional tanks, the operating pressure is typically not higher than 700 bar. Even at this high pressure and room temperature, the gas density is 1.8 times less than liquid hydrogen, which means less hydrogen for a given tank size. Larger tanks would be needed to store the same amount of hydrogen as liquid hydrogen tanks. For the current gaseous hydrogen tanks, pressurized to 700 bars, the tank volume to store the same amount of energy would be 7.5 times that of the JP-7 fuel tank.    Therefore, three problems related to tank design and integration into overall vehicle design are  tank volume, to which tank structural mass is related, and tank materials which are related to decrease of structural mass. Hydrogen tanks have larger volumes because of lower values of liquid or gaseous hydrogen volumetric energy densities than conventional aircraft fuel. The extremely high operation pressure of gaseous hydrogen, which would equal 2,000 bar to pack the same energy as LH2 in the same volume, results in unacceptable structural mass with traditional materials. The technology readiness levels for the expected nano materials are not high enough to consider them in the tank design in the foreseeable future.      Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.       This study will address volumetric integration of hydrogen tanks into aircraft configurations that would match tank volume requirements.    Upper consideration will guide in matching tank to the aircraft  GH2 tanks to the short route commuter, and LH2 to the long route transcontinental and intercontinental aircraft.    Currently there is a lot of work in industry that spans more immediate needs that airline industry will face with regulations by 2030 such as  accommodation of current aircraft to larger tanks, accommodation of airport infrastructure to supply of hydrogen, and development and testing of new engines to use either hydrogen directly or through conversion to electricity with fuel cells.    There is a case in academia that parallel this proposal.          Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   Phase 1  Research similar work   Phase 2  Select two reference passenger vehicles class based on the flight length  short and long.   Phase 3  Select gaseous or liquid hydrogen tanks for two above classes.   Phase 4  Study different vehicle configurations for each of the selected aircraft.    Phase 5  Evaluate percentage of tank volume versus aircraft volume as measure of one configuration over the others for each class.   After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    The above outlined volume trade would be the first step. The next step in thank integration would be a system analysis, that would address aircraft system weight estimates due to tank design, cryogenic or pneumatic system review and design and comparison with current vehicle designs used as the baseline designs.    Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    Fall back on existing aircraft deigns, fit tanks to their outer mold lines and estimate modification impact to passenger capacity, what has been probably already done by industry.  ",,,,,,
Initial Study of Airspace Operational Impacts of Airline Contrail Mitigation Actions,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Initial Study of Airspace Operational Impacts of Airline Contrail Mitigation Actions   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong?

How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches? If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.   MOTIVATION   The aviation community is actively tackling a potentially significant contributor to global climate change  persistent contrails formed from aviation operations. The Contrail Impact Task Force which includes most major U.S.-based airlines (e.g., American, Alaska, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, United, UPS), several international carriers, NASA, Boeing, Airbus, GE, Google, Breakthrough Energy, academia, and other research organizations is concerned that airspace operations could be a potential barrier to performing contrail avoidance actions as part of routine flight operations.   There is a need to perform an initial analysis of whether such a potential barrier exists and, if so, the scope of the challenge. This analysis requires an independent, trusted source that has credibility with airspace and air traffic modeling, which NASA has and can provide. The initial results would have broad visibility in the aviation community and can help air carriers plan upcoming flight trials and incorporate contrail formation avoidance actions into accepted operational flight plans.   PROPOSAL   The first part of the proposed effort is to calculate ATC-related metrics (e.g., sector counts, proximity events) across the NAS utilizing existing simulation data collected during a prior study commissioned by the ARMD Portfolio Analysis and Management Office (PAMO). The NAS-wide analysis proposed here 1) identify specific  hotspot  areas of the NAS that require deeper dive analysis  2) uncover airspace complexities of contrail formation avoidance that may require additional algorithm development  and 3) raise additional questions for follow-on research has not been conducted previously. Prior analysis of four sectors in Kansas City Center found that contrail avoidance actions would not lead to an increase in sector counts above capacity.1-2 However, the researchers did not extend this analysis to the entire NAS in follow-on studies. Instead, they focused on 1) refining their environmental impact models of contrails  and 2) comparing contrail formation avoidance strategies in terms of the tradeoff in fuel burn and delay.   The second part of the proposed effort is to receive and incorporate into NAS-wide simulations flight plan data from a major airline that includes 1) realistic business preferences  and 2) vertical and lateral flight plans, with and without changes for contrail avoidance (e.g., American Airlines (AA)  potentially leveraging an existing Space Act Agreement (SAA)). This would be unprecedented research that the aviation community could utilize to shape the future approach for routine operationalization of contrail avoidance.   The first part of the proposed effort will be documented in an interim report and presented to NASA, the Contrail Impact Task Force, and other stakeholders. The second part of the proposed effort will be added to the interim report to produce a final report that will also be presented to stakeholders and published. The final report will also document a validation of the contrail formation model utilized in the proposed effort that will include comparing model outputs to satellite images.   BACKGROUND   There is an increasing body of evidence that persistent contrails formed from aviation operations is a significant contributor to global climate change. One study estimated that persistent contrails contribute about 57  of total Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) from aviation operations (Figure 1).      Figure 1. Global aviation Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF).3   The aviation community is taking this matter seriously. Recently, several airlines and ANSPs have conducted flight trials to evaluate the operational feasibility and potential environmental impact of contrail avoidance strategies. These initial contrail mitigation trials and related modeling and analysis efforts found a net environmental benefit from reducing contrail-induced cirrus cloud cover trapping heat in the atmosphere, even with the additional fuel burn from flying at sub-optimal cruise altitudes.   Following a workshop co-sponsored by NASA in September 2022 on Operationalizing Contrail Avoidance, industry formed the Contrail Impact Task Force, which meets quarterly to share information about contrail mitigation trials and other efforts associated with contrail impact modeling. In addition to business incentives, policy, technology, operational procedures, and fully understanding the scientific impacts of contrail avoidance, the task force raised airspace operations as a potential barrier. There is concern that contrail avoidance actions could 1) create workload issues for Air Traffic Control (ATC)  and 2) create additional airspace congestion.   NASA s hypothesis is that airspace operations are a minimal barrier to establishing contrail mitigation programs because 1) only a small percentage of flights would be impacted about 7.5  of flights in an initial NASA simulation study in which flight cruise altitudes were changed to avoid contrail formation  and 2) the airspace and air traffic management system has embedded design flexibility to accommodate airspace user preferences for flight plan routes and altitudes. Existing unique NASA capabilities and expertise can be leveraged to produce analytic evidence to support or refute this hypothesis in support of the efforts of the Contrail Impact Task Force, NASA, and the aviation community at large.

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?   The proposed effort is an initial study to identify  hotspot  areas of the NAS that require deeper dive analysis, uncover airspace complexities of contrail formation avoidance, and raise additional questions for follow-on research. Depending on the results of this initial analysis, follow-on activities could involve partnerships with industry (e.g., Contrail Impact Task Force or other groups) and or other NASA projects (e.g., ATM-X DIP) to develop optimized flight plans that balance contrail avoidance, fuel burn, delay, sector counts, proximity events, and other factors in compliance with airspace structures constraints.   Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?   The first portion of the proposed effort is to calculate ATC-related metrics from simulation data with and without contrail avoidance that were collected for the foundational study commissioned by ARMD PAMO. This work is feasible technically because the required data to perform this analysis already exists.   The second portion of the proposed effort involves receiving flight plan data with and without changes for contrail avoidance from a major airline that includes business preferences to incorporate into NAS Digital Twin (NDT) simulations (Figure 2). The proposed approach to obtain this data is through an existing SAA. If this is not feasible, our alternative approach is to develop our own model working with subject matter experts (e.g., former airline and FAA folks with related knowledge and experience) of airline business preferences and resulting flight plans, with and without contrail avoidance actions.

Sustainable bio-aerogels for direct air carbon capture and storage,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Sustainable bio-aerogels for direct air carbon capture and storage   Description of Work      As outlined in the US 2021 Aviation Climate Action Plan, the aviation industry has an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050  1 . For this purpose, governments and aircraft manufacturers are developing and pursuing action plans and technologies such as developing more efficient aircraft (e.g., hybrid and electric aircraft) and using low-carbon alternative fuels (e.g., biofuels) to reduce the aviation carbon footprint  2 . However, these efforts are not enough for the industry to meet its carbon reduction goals as the global demand for air travel is rising. Therefore, complementary solutions are needed to offer a safe, affordable, and scalable pathway for aviation emission reduction.    Recently, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) based technology was proposed by the major industry players as a complementary plan to capture the residual emissions remaining from aircraft directly from the air and later store them underground  3 . Although these proposed ground facilities can potentially capture tons of carbon directly from the air, they require so much energy to capture carbon dioxide, purify it, and transport it underground for permanent storage which make them not an affordable and scalable way to sequester carbon  4 .    In this proposal, an alternative approach for capturing carbon dioxide directly from air will be investigated by developing novel sustainable bio-based aerogels. Bio-aerogels are low-density materials with high open-porosity and high specific surface area that are made from biodegradable polymer precursors such as proteins, starch, sugar cane and vegetable oils. Recent developments have shown these materials are excellent for various applications like environmental remediation  5 . The NASA GRC Polymer Aerogel Team has recently considered a new chemistry for the synthesis of bio-based aerogels that can be potentially utilized for carbon dioxide adsorption, and storage. These materials can be chemically functionalized using specific moieties such as organic amines to adsorb carbon dioxide directly from air into their nanoporous structures under ambient conditions. The significance of using bio-aerogels for environmental remediation applications in comparison with traditional polymer aerogels is in their ability to decompose into natural substances in a short period of time which is increasingly important for a sustainable future. In addition to this added benefit, the bio-aerogel still retains typical aerogel properties such as lightweight, low density, low thermal conductivity, acoustic impedance, and structural integrity from cryogenic temperatures to 500  C.   The utilization of bio-aerogels with carbon dioxide adhesion capability in Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) based technologies can significantly reduce the overall cost of these systems  1) it will create a more environmentally-friendly process and be more attractive to industry as the bio-aerogels will be used for the carbon dioxide capture without any purification need, 2) these materials will also act as natural filter with high storage capacity due to their high porosity ( 95 ) and high internal surface area (800m2 g), and 3) due to their sustainability and biocompatibility, they can be directly stored underground without any environmental concern.

Milestones Deliverables   A feasibility and optimization study will be performed to determine viable bio-based aerogel candidates. Milestone 1 entails the synthesis of baseline bio-aerogels and characterization through a series of thermal, mechanical, and physical property analysis. Milestone 2 will focus on down-selecting viable candidates for fabrication of Optimal formulations. The optimized bio-aerogels will be selected based on comparison of key performance parameters of current state of the art materials for carbon capture.

In addition, collaboration with industry will be sought in order to implement the bio-aerogel materials into DACCS systems. It is anticipated that this will also be of interest to areas within STMD for applications such as Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) of the Atmosphere Revitalization Systems (ARS) for crewed vehicles and habitats.      Project Viability    Although the confidence for success in this proposed work is high, the potential for redirection of research due to unforeseen failures or other circumstances is a possibility. With this adverse situation in mind, there are measures built into the proposal to avoid such issues. Due to the nature of the research to be attempted, an optimization study will be conducted to first assess viability and baseline properties.  This offers alternative approaches to fabricate various chemistries to best define the optimal methods and materials to make the bio-aerogel. If the initial approach is not feasible, we will adjust the parameters such as chemical precursors, synthesis methods, and chemical composition. ",,,,,,
Eco-Friendly Thermal Management Solutions to Enable Green Aviation,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title  Eco-Friendly Thermal Management Solutions to Enable Green Aviation   The aviation industry is a rapidly growing sector with an increasing environmental impact. At just a fraction of the global production, Airbus s fleet forecast alone projects a 4.1  compounding annual growth rate and over 40,000 new aircraft and freighters to be required over the next 20 years  1 . Consequently, meeting both net zero emissions and sustainability goals requires next generation aircraft to incorporate reusability and recyclability of materials in their design criteria, creating a closed-loop lifecycle, while simultaneously providing performance gains for improved efficiency.   By leveraging eco-friendly thermal management solutions, aircraft, in particular electrified and hybrid aircraft, and urban air mobility (UAM) systems can benefit from reduced operating temperatures with enhanced efficiency while also taking advantage of material recyclability for reuse in a sustainable closed-loop product lifecycle. Component systems such as batteries, fuel cells, and electric motors provide large opportunity for impact where increased specific power, energy and reliability could be achieved through improved thermal management and contribute to improved aircraft efficiency and reduced emissions. Specifically, this proposal will target the enhancement of electric motors for aircraft propulsion through the development of multifunctional high thermal conductivity bobbins that extract, store, and redistribute the generated heat. In electric motors, bobbins are the permanent containers for the retention of coiled wire shapes and rigidity, and enable easier assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core. Given that these coils are the greatest source of heating within the stator and typically within the whole electric motor, efficient thermal management through the bobbin is critical to motor performance.   Based on a study for NASA electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) electric motor design, the stator winding thermomechanical stress is a more significant limiting factor for electric motors than thermochemical aging of the insulation  2 . For this reason, cooling strategies and technologies that reduce thermally induced stator coil mechanical stress are needed to advance the achievable performance of EAP motors. One path forward to achieve reduced coil mechanical stress is through an in-slot direct cooling design  3 . Additionally, a recent study at NASA GRC leveraged a multi-physics design optimization model to demonstrate mass reduction achieved with an in-slot design relative to a water-jacket design, as well as increased motor efficiency by incorporating a bobbin with increased thermal conductivity  4 .    Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-material designs to advance electric motor state-of-the-art through enhanced thermal management capabilities and reduced thermo-mechanical stress. Multi-material including ceramics, high-performance composites, alumina-filled Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), carbon-reinforced Polyetherimide (ULTEM), Silicon Carbide, and Boron Nitride are prime candidates demonstrating desired properties for this application. Combined with in-house additive manufacturing capabilities and prior success 3D printing multi-materials  5, 6, 7 , designs incorporating complex geometry, cooling channels, or reduced weight could also be achieved. This is especially beneficial with fabricating materials that are difficult to machine through traditional methods and could provide new avenues for the application of these materials. Moreover, thermal storage materials such phase change materials (PCM) can be integrated into the bobbins design to store the extracted heat from the motor wiring and then recycle and use the stored thermal energy elsewhere in the aircraft. Additionally, high thermal conductivity interface coatings which facilitate increased thermal extraction from the coil winding to bobbin could be also investigated.    Although there has been plenty of work in motor design for propulsion, there has not been a large focus on material development and thermal management for the bobbin component. In one study, a negative correlation with increasing bobbin thermal conductivity and decreased bobbin temperature, achieved through injected molded plastics with fillers, was demonstrated  8 . Another investigation found similar results for a direct winding heat exchanger design  9 . Research in this area is multi-faceted and has not fully explored the potential of thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-materials, where polyamides and glass-fiber reinforcement have been the common materials currently used  10, 11 . Therefore, an opportunity for fabricating an electric motor with improved efficiency is provided by developing a bobbin with increased thermal conductivity for enhanced thermal management. This design should also balance a reduced mass and provide sufficient reduction in thermo-mechanical stresses for improved and reliable performance. Overall, the enhanced efficiency of electric motors and the reduction of power losses due to excess heat will expand the capabilities of electrified aircraft and UAM while increasing sustainability and durability. Furthermore, thermoplastics such as PEKK and ULTEM provide an opportunity for further mitigating waste and emissions through recycling, as they can be recovered, remelted, and reused for fabrication in a closed-loop cycle for green aviation.       Several milestones are anticipated for this work    Identify thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-material architecture for bobbin fabrication (12 2023)   Design and develop processing conditions for successful multi-material additive manufacturing (5 2024)   Evaluate multi-material composite thermal and thermomechanical properties under simulated operational environmental conditions (7 2024)   Fabricate proto-type components using additive manufacturing approaches (9 2024)   This work should be evaluated on the successful fabrication of a bobbin as well as its thermal management capability, where increased thermal conductivity and reduced maximum bobbin temperature will demonstrate improved performance relative to a baseline design. Additionally, the developed bobbin s ability to extract heat will be measured with the use of customized experimental setup.      Upon successful fabrication of a thermally conductive electrically insulative bobbin, next steps could include further material development and incorporating fabricated components in a motor prototype. A full evaluation of enhanced thermal management for an enhanced motor and a baseline motor could be conducted for comparison, for instance at NASA AFRC or at GRC with small motor test facilities established under CAMIEM. Additionally, more complex components and improved integration within the electric motor could be investigated and tests conducted to determine performance gains over the baseline motor. This could include consolidating multiple components into a single manufacturing step, such as 3d printing a bobbin with copper coils simultaneously. This could result in reduced number of parts, reduced failure points, and reduced weight. There may also be opportunities for transition and collaboration with other NASA projects such as testing with the in-slot cooling rig being constructed under RVLT or the statorette heating cooling rig at GRC. At a later stage this could also involve identifying an opportunity for an in-flight test such as with the sustainable flight demonstrator project. Upon successful demonstration, this technology could also be transferred to engine companies.       With the array of in-house additive manufacturing capabilities available, we are able to 3D print even the highest-performance high-temperature materials available on the market and do not anticipate any feasibility issues. However, if issues do arise, fabrication could be outsourced to local vendors. If there is an issue regarding the chosen thermally conductive electrically insulative material, whether its printability or performance, alternative materials could be used for fabrication. If the entire approach was deemed infeasible, alternative thermal management solutions could be explored. Battery housings and heat sinks leveraging these materials could be fabricated to assist with the prevention and mitigation of thermal runaway events. This is of critical importance for the adoption of electrified aircraft for green aviation and could provide both thermo-mechanical robustness alongside weight savings and increased power density. Additionally, the fabrication of heat exchangers with multifunctional materials for extreme environments could serve to provide enhanced thermal management capability alongside improved reliability and performance. A novel design incorporating lightweight high-performance materials could also be fabricated through additive manufacturing and contribute to weight reduction of the aircraft.   References   Airbus.

Integrated Catalytic Converters for Air Vehicle NOx Emission Control,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Integrated Catalytic Converters for Air Vehicle NOx Emission Control   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches? If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.    Text BoxNASA challenge  This work has the ambition to design a catalytic converter for NOx emission control using computational methods targeted for an aircraft engine environment. Uncontrolled emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), formed as side-products during combustion of jet fuel, is a global environmental and health hazard. 1  Notably, NOx causes acid rain, smog, and eutrophication. In addition, NOx indirectly contributes to global warming through a complex reaction network that generates the greenhouse gases ozone and nitrous oxide. The adverse influence is significant as the effective global warming potential of NOx is estimated to be 30-35 times that of CO2 over a 20 years perspective. 2  Unfavorably for aircrafts, the harm increases when NOx is emitted at higher altitudes. While emission of NOx from automobile combustion engines has been successfully reduced using catalytic converters, the corresponding emission control is lacking for air vehicles. A key obstacle to the implementation of traditional catalytic converters in aircraft is its negative impact on the performance of the engine. For efficient NOx conversion, the exhaust gas needs extended contact time with the catalyst s surface by passing the gas over a catalyst-impregnated filter bed. For aircraft, such an arrangement would result in decreased jet thrust   thus reducing engine performance to an unacceptable level. Leveraging the years of industrial research on NOx emission control for automobiles, this project aims to outline pathways toward alternative designs of catalytic converters for state-of-the-art jet engines. Furthermore, the aspiration is to enable codesign of future engines with the vision of power-efficient and truly carbon-neutral jet aircraft of tomorrow.  Such aircraft of the future will be optimized for both performance and emissions reduction. In this project, we will tailor, using advanced computational methods, novel catalysts targeted for aircraft engine environments and NOx reduction. As far as the author is aware, this modeling effort (albeit state-of-the-art in catalysis research) is a novel direction for catalytic converters designed for aircraft that can open up multiple future avenues in green aviation research.   Objective and benefit  The overall objective of the proposed project is to lay the theoretical foundation for the design of an integrated catalytic converter for high velocity airflows. The converter solution will be optimized for aircraft conditions and will be applied as a surface coating on components within the jet engine (see Figure 1). This would result in minimal influence on the propulsion with the aim to reduce a significant fraction (1-5 ) of the NOx emission. Hence, the converter will be designed to balance engine performance and emission reduction. With a combined annual NOx emission from global air traffic of 106 ton or 30 106 ton CO2,eq (i.e., same order of magnitude as the total energy related CO2 emission of a mid-sized US state), 1,3,4  removing even a small portion of the total NOx emission would have a large beneficial impact on both global health and global warming. Additionally, the modeling framework developed here will be specifically developed to have flexibility to address NOx abatement in other engine systems to allow for design of future jet engine solutions approaching 100  greenhouse gas neutrality.      Approach  We will leverage established modeling methods used for identification of the so-called  three way catalyst  (Pt) used for NOx emission control in automobiles. 5,6  We aim to recast these established models in the context of air vehicles that operate at different conditions and have altered design criteria compared to automobiles. In particular, it is believed that the optimal catalyst could vary within the combustion chamber and turbine along with variations in local temperature, pressure, and gas velocity. In addition, materials durability (including high-temperature stability) and expense will be auxiliary design criteria allowing for a trade-off between catalysts performance and cost.   In heterogenous catalysis theory, it is common to employ a so-called Sabatier analysis of the factors influencing the catalytic system. One benefit of this approach is that the catalytic activity of a catalyst can be reduced to a few key parameters, parameters that are easy to compute or measure experimentally. The approach can be used to screen for ideal catalysts within a large materials search space. We strive to mainly harness literature data in this work, with complementary first principles atomic scale modeling of missing reaction energies and barriers.     A picture containing graphical user interface  Description automatically generatedIn principle, the catalytic performance is defined by the free energy landscape of reactants, intermediates, and products on the catalytic surface. Typically, the best catalyst is the one that balances between properly activating the reacting species without binding the product too strongly (which leads to surface poisoning). The energetics of the surface species are not independent but scale within groups of similar compounds. 7 For example, it is common that all species that bind via an N atom (such as NO, NH etc) scale with the adsorption energy of atomic nitrogen, while carbon compounds (e.g., CO) scale with atomic carbon. In addition, the energy barrier going from one state to another has been found to scale linearly with the reaction energy of that step (so-called BEP relations). 8  By joining these relationship, one can express the energy landscape reduced to a few key descriptors (adsorption energies). The rate of catalysis, also known as turn over frequency (TOF), is thereafter obtained by converting the energy landscapes to reaction rate constants and solving equilibrium (or steady state) concentrations of the reacting species under predefined conditions such as temperature and gas pressures within a microkinetic model. The resulting activity plot (Figure 2) is a key tool for comparing catalyst candidates.   Text BoxIn NOx converters, NO and NO2 are converted by a reducing agent. In the three-way automobile catalysts, this function is provided by species formed due to incomplete combustion such as CO and various hydrocarbons (HC). The end-product are the relatively harmless species N2, O2, H2O, and CO2. For automobiles, it is important that all these species are converted. Similarly, the ability to push towards more complete combustion is attractive also to aircrafts reducing soot and particulate formation as well as improving energy usage. 9  However, the conditions of an aircraft engine differ substantially (in terms of temperature, and temperature gradient, gas composition and velocity) from automobiles, why the analysis of the proper catalyst(s) in aircraft setting will have to be redone.    To speed up the search for ideal catalyst, we will exploit adsorption energies of the anticipated key adsorbates such as N, C, and O from large databases augmented with machine learning methods. 10,11  We will search for monometallic and multimetallic catalysts. Mid- and high-entropy alloys, such as GRX-810, are particularly attractive as they can combine high-temperature stability with high catalytic activity.          Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   Milestone Q1  Determine reaction pathway of NOx conversion at operational conditions.      Success criteria  Reproduce reported energetics where applicable within  0.2 eV.   Milestone Q2  Establish property-activity relationship for subsequent catalysts screening.        Success criteria  Reproduce experimental rates ( 102) for simulations on calibration system.   Milestone Q3  Screen for mono- and bimetallic catalysts using available databases.       Success criteria  100-1000 materials evaluated with 1-3 crystal surface orientations each.   Milestone Q4  Co-optimize high entropy alloy catalyst with respect to durability, cost, and activity.       Success criteria  Combined with Q3, identify 1-4 promising catalyst candidates.      After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    Apart from proposing design strategies for aircraft NOx emission control, the successful project will generate a state-of-the art modeling framework and set the stage for research in several directions, internally within TTT and NASA but also with external partners. One future avenue is a continued evaluation of NOx emission control from jet engines in tandem with engine engineers and experimental investigations. With small modifications, the modeling framework will, in addition, be applicable to aircraft configurations using other propulsion systems. This includes the use of alternative fuels such as H2 or the use of electrical jet turbines powered by a centrally located combustion engine that would allow for better control of the emitted gases. 12 14     Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    The two main risk predicted for this project are that i), the reaction network for the NOx abatement in generated from combustion of traditional jet fuels becomes overly complex to be properly addressed during the project  and ii), that the more detailed analysis suggests that the amount of abated NOx with the integrated catalytic converter will be insignificant. Both risks can be alleviated by switching to another (simplified) system. In case of i), the reaction system will be reduced to include NO and CO only (leaving the carbohydrates and NO2 aside). This will still allow for extraction of relevant results for the jet engine use case. In case of ii), a future engine design will be considered where the exhaust gas is separated from the jet stream allowing for longer catalyst contact time and enhanced degree of NOx conversion.

Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Health Monitoring for Mechanical and Electrochemical Degradation in Structural Batteries.     Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).     Text BoxBatteries are critical for powering future zero emissions vehicle concepts in the automotive, aerospace (e.g., urban air mobility, hybrid all electric aircraft), industrial (e.g., autonomous drones), and consumer sectors (Figure 1   1  ).  Recently,  massless  structural batteries have emerged that are capable of both supporting structural loads and storing energy   2  .  They are called  massless  because they store energy in structures already needed in aircraft designs, thus no extra mass is required for separate battery storage.  The energy density and multifunctionality of structural batteries will allow a paradigm shift for electrical vehicle designs, leading to increased range and performance as well as a new generation of vehicle designs not possible using conventional batteries.  For these multifunctional battery structures to achieve their full potential, they must be used without external battery management systems.  At the same time, their safety must be guaranteed, especially for manned vehicle applications.  The proposed work aims to address safety assurances for future massless structural batteries by nondestructively studying mechanical and electrochemical degradation mechanisms in these newly developed batteries.  The ultimate goals of this work are (a) to build an understanding of the degradation mechanisms of massless structural batteries and (b) to establish and demonstrate inspection techniques that can be applied during operation to inform maintenance actions and grounding of aircraft before catastrophic failure.          Health monitoring for batteries is important for their safe operation, especially in power-hungry electric aircraft where batteries are stressed through high discharge rates and extreme operating environments.  Battery health monitoring is a new field, with much of the focus in the research community on commercial lithium-ion battery chemistries and their state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC) (e.g.,   3  ,   4  ).  Measurements of the SOC and SOH are meant to determine when batteries need to be changed, not on whether they are safe for operation.  On the other hand, NASA s recent work under the CAS SPARRCI program sought to monitor the internal structure of batteries using resonance-based and guided wave ultrasonic methods   5  .  The developments under SPARRCI included successful monitoring of structural resonance changes in lithium metal batteries during the electrochemical cycling process (Figure 2), as well as a demonstration of in-situ application of the developed techniques.  The resonance-based approaches identified under SPARRCI allow through-thickness structure and material property changes to be monitored, and guided wave approaches allow broad area coverage and localization of damage.      Figure 2  Reflection coefficient spectrum measurements made on lithium metal pouch cell batteries at charge rates ranging from 0.1C to 0.5C, where 1C is the rate required to fully charge the battery in one hour.  Resonances are influenced by the layered structure and are shown as minima in the color maps.  The resonances shift toward lower frequencies during cell degradation.     In the composite massless batteries that will be explored, the resonance-based methods (local) and guided wave methods (long range) will be applied to allow multi-scale monitoring of battery and structural health during mechanical and electrochemical cycling.  The work will leverage expertise developed in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of battery health within in LaRC s Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Branch (NESB) as well as composite and battery fabrication expertise in LaRC s Advanced Materials and Processing Branch.        Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   Production of composite structural batteries (Q1-Q2)   In-house expertise in composite processing and battery fabrication will be a key enabler of this milestone, as well as manufacturing methods developed within the research community (e.g.,   2  ).  At least 10 battery specimens with qualitatively similar electrochemical performance will be produced during this phase.  Performance will be verified through electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) after fabrication.   Assembly and setup of measurement techniques on dummy specimens (Q1)   In parallel with battery fabrication, inert composite layups using the same materials and stacking sequences as structural batteries will be made without active electrochemical components.  These dummy specimens will allow rapid tuning of the inspection approaches and will reveal any potential issues with acoustic impedance mismatch and attenuation in dissimilar materials.  By the end of the first quarter, a baseline inspection capability will be ready for battery inspection.  Note that this is only possible in this short timeline because of the foundation laid through the CAS SPARRCI effort.   Baseline measurements on batteries (Q2)   After fabricating battery specimens, baseline data will be collected before electrical cycling or mechanical loading.  These measurements will highlight the reproducibility of resonance and guided wave data among specimens and will be as a baseline to which the degraded response can be compared.     Cycling and monitoring of batteries (Q2   Q4)   Mechanical and electrochemical cycling of battery specimens will seed degradation that can be monitored using ultrasonic NDE approaches.   Electrical cycling will be conducted under constant current conditions to achieve a charge and discharge rate between 0.5C and 1C based on estimated cell capacities.  Three degradation scenarios will be examined  degradation due to electrical cycling alone, degradation due to mechanical loading alone, and combined mechanical loading with electrical cycling.      Report Out (Q3 - Q4)   The novelty of the proposed work makes it viable for technical publication and dissemination to the research community.  In the last phase of the work, the team will output at least one (possibly more) technical publication in addition to a summary report for TTT.       After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    The proposed work will lead to a TRL 4 demonstration of battery inspection techniques in relevant materials in a lab environment.  Both the mechanical and electrochemical loading scenarios will be simple in comparison to real-world operation.  In next steps, a database of degradation and sensor responses in more relevant operational conditions will be developed through random walk electrical cycling and vibration testing.  This data will be essential so that machine learning techniques can be trained and applied to structural-scale batteries to identify hazardous off-nominal conditions.    The proposed effort works in synergy with NASA s ongoing battery development and integrated vehicle health monitoring (IVHM) efforts.  Known transition paths include work under TTT for IVHM focused on sustainability, where these battery monitoring approaches could be another input into the framework for assessing vehicle health.  The work also supports structural composite battery development efforts within NASA and industry, where degradation mechanisms have not yet been explored.    Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    The highest technical risk in this work is in repeatable production of composite structural batteries and the ability to degrade them in a meaningful way for health monitoring technique development.  If in-house fabrication proves infeasible in three months, then the work would pivot to state-of-the-art commercial batteries.  High energy density lithium-ion batteries like those used in commercial drones or electric vehicles would be purchased and used as the primary test article during test execution.  Through this pivot, the work would bolster and further mature in situ health monitoring approaches for high energy batteries with nearer term application.  The transition paths supporting ongoing IVHM and battery development work would remain valid.       References     1     L. Asp, ""Tech Briefs,"" 2022.  Online .

Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Persistent Solar Power Station   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.       We are proposing a persistent high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) solar power station. The idea involves an airborne solar panel carried by two HALE aircraft operating at high altitude over a long duration. This is illustrated in the following figure. The electric propulsion on the HALE aircraft is powered by the energy harvested by the solar panel. The power provided by the solar panel can be beamed to UAM aircraft, enabling the aircraft to extend ranges and operate with more passenger capacity. The power can also be beamed to a ground station for energy storage.       NASA Helios was a solar powered UAV designed by Aerovironment  1 . The first flight ended in a mishap. Subsequent investigations attributed one of the causes of the mishap to ""nonlinear stability and control problem involving complex interactions among the flexible structure, unsteady aerodynamics, flight control system, propulsion system, the environmental conditions, and vehicle flight dynamics."" As a result, the accident investigation board made several recommendations one of which is to ""Develop more advanced, multidisciplinary (structures, aeroelastic, aerodynamics, atmospheric, materials, propulsion, controls, etc)  time-domain  analysis methods appropriate to highly flexible,  morphing  vehicles.""      The goal of the Helios was largely unfulfilled. If successful, it could have heralded in a new aerospace infrastructure program that could have wide ranging applications from providing power to internet services anywhere in the world.          Persistent Solar Power Station      The proposal is different from the Helios in the platform configuration. Applying the recommendations by the accident investigation board, the proposal will focus on developing new capabilities and better understanding of multidisciplinary interactions between nonlinear large deflection structure  2 , aeroelasticity, unsteady aerodynamics, and flight control for highly flexible HALE aircraft. New capabilities could include structural dynamic tools, unsteady aerodynamic tools for large motion moving aerodynamic surfaces, and nonlinear aeroservoelasticity tools for flight dynamic prediction and flight control synthesis of HALE aircraft. These capabilities are not widely available. Some capabilities exist at universities, but they tend to be low-fidelity tools  3 . The ultimate goal is to achieve high-fidelity aeroservoelastic capabilities.       1  https   www.nasa.gov wp-content uploads 2016 07 64317main helios.pdf, Date of Retrieval  October 13, 2023    2  Nguyen, N. and Ting, E.,  Large Deflection Aeroelasticity and Aeroelastic Lifting Line Theory for Examination of Aerodynamic Effects and Nonlinear Limit Cycle Oscillations,  AIAA ASCE AHS ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, AIAA-2018-1954, January 2018.    3   Palacios, R., Murua, J., and Cook, R., ""Structural and Aerodynamic Models in Nonlinear Flight Dynamics of Very Flexible Aircraft,"" AIAA Journal, Vol. 48, No. 11, November 2010      Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   A tentative set of milestones are as follows       Month 1 - Concept development and vehicle sizing   Month 4 - Finite-element model development for nonlinear large deflection structure of HALE aircraft   Month 6 - Coupled structural dynamics - unsteady aerodynamic (fluid-structure interaction) simulation   Month 8 - Nonlinear aeroservoelastic model development for flight dynamics and control   Month 10 - Flight control design for high altitude gust rejection, modal suppression, and station keeping   Month 12 - Final report submission      The metrics for evaluating the proposed work will be new capabilities and tools that can predict nonlinear aeroelasticity for large deflection structures with wing tip displacement at least 20  of the semi-span. Additionally, metrics for flight control will be used to evaluate the gust disturbance rejection, modal suppression, and station keeping to maintain precise altitude and orientation to within certain specifications.      After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?       If successful, the immediate next step would involve identifying a potential project (TTT) for transition and briefing to industry (e.g., Aerovironment).  The follow-on research would include  low-speed wind tunnel test at university facility (e.g. University of Washington) on a highly flexible aircraft model with active control surfaces, developing higher fidelity tools for nonlinear aeroelasticity, FSI, and aeroservoelasticity.      Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    The proposed work is considered highly challenging. Time constraint will play a major role in the success of the project, but if this constraint is removed, then some measure of success will likely be realized by means of having new tools and capabilities. Thus, the technical risk is likely be driven by the schedule. It is possible that not all objectives as proposed can be realized in the time frame. From the operational perspective, the key is to determine feasibility of the concept in terms of flight dynamics, stability, and control. It is possible that the flight control could be very challenging and success criteria could not be met. If so, resizing the aerodynamic configuration to increase stability and structure to increase rigidity may be required. This could potentially increase the aircraft weight and thereby lead to increased power requirements. The flight control challenge might be reduced but the benefit might decrease as well. ",,,,,,
Thrust Generation in Electrified Aircraft Heat Exchanger Ducts,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   Title  Thrust Generation in Electrified Aircraft Heat Exchanger Ducts   Problem description, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits      Large electrified aircraft produce orders of magnitude more electronics heat than even the most advanced electrical systems on current aircraft. More heat means more drag on ram-air heat exchangers (HXs), which are the existing state of the art for aircraft heat rejection. Ram-air HXs sized for electrified aircraft could create so much drag and weight that they could negate the benefits from electrification  1,2 . A HX that not only eliminates drag but creates thrust would solve this problem.   Text BoxThere has been a renewed interest in thrust-producing HXs via the Meredith effect  3,4,5 . Meredith effect HXs were previously used in some WWII-era piston engine aircraft, like the P-51 Mustang. Current passenger aircraft do not utilize these designs because jet engines naturally have higher air cooling. Additionally, engine oil heat is typically used to pre-heat the fuel or is rejected via a surface heat exchanger installed in the bypass duct rather than in a standalone duct. However large electrified aircraft likely cannot rely completely on surface (or outer mold line) heat exchangers and will need to reject heat via a pumped-fluid loop to a ram-air heat exchanger  6,7 . The majority of proposed electrified aircraft architectures utilize a single-phase pumped fluid loop  8  operating at temperatures up to 200  C, which makes them an ideal candidate for a Meredith effect HX. The recent analytical work has shown the potential for thrust production in electrified aircraft HX ducts, however, to date there is little to no evidence that any designs have been built or tested.   The proposed work would determine the feasibility of a thrust-producing HX for a hybrid-electric aircraft in realistic operating conditions, evaluating potential thrust vs. rejection temperature. This would involve sizing and optimization of the ducted HX at each rejection temperature. If thrust can be produced at a reasonable rejection temperature, a sub-scale HX core would be built and tested at design and off-design operating conditions to measure generated thrust. The HX itself would be of the microchannel type, which have been shown to have higher performance and lower drag and compared to the typical plate-fin heat exchangers used in aviation  9 . The HX would utilize additive manufacturing techniques, which can create the complex microchannel structures more easily and affordably then traditional chemical etching and diffusion bonding processes. HX materials to be investigated include metals as well as plastics, which have recently shown potential benefits in a number of different heat exchanger applications  10,11 . If successful, this work would demonstrate light-weight and zero net drag thermal management which is an enabling technology for NASA s long-term goals of net-zero carbon emissions from aviation.      Milestones      Month 1-3  Heat exchanger and duct analysis and optimization to determine feasibility of thrust production at realistic single-aisle hybrid-electric aircraft operating conditions   Month 4-9  Selection of heat exchanger design. Design and procurement of test rig for measuring thrust. Procurement fabrication of heat exchanger.   Month 10-12  Testing of heat exchanger. Documentation of results.      Transition Plan and Follow-On Research      After this work is completed, next steps would be integration into an electrified powertrain thermal management system, such as the one being developed under the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions  Subsonic Single Aft Engine project (CAS SUSAN). Potential follow-on research could include evaluation of methods to increase HX rejection temperatures if this research determines that is desirable. Such methods could include integration of a heat pump or engine heat source. Other follow-on research could include investigating HX designs that are integrated into electric fan ducts, as that has been shown to have greater performance than standalone ducts in certain conditions  4 .      Pivot Plan      If the initial approach is not feasible, it would likely be because the needed rejection temperature is higher than the typical temperature limits for electrified aircraft components. In that case, thrust production would not occur, but drag reduction could still be demonstrated and measured. Alternatively, a heat pump system could be sized and optimized to generate the needed higher rejection temperatures. Testing could still occur without a heat pump, as the fluid temperatures would be provided by the test rig fluid system or by integrated heating elements.

Ion Propulsion Systems and Advanced Multi-Sensor Perception for Unmanned Aerial Systems  Leveraging Space Exploration Advances for Sustainable Terrestrial Aviation,TTT Green Aviation,,"Ion Propulsion Systems and Advanced Multi-Sensor Perception for Unmanned Aerial Systems  Leveraging Space Exploration Advances for Sustainable Terrestrial Aviation      The rapid advancement of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology has revolutionized the aviation industry. However, traditional UAS propulsion mechanisms pose significant limitations, including noise pollution, low energy efficiency, and limited maneuverability. These issues are especially evident in residential settings and sensitive environments where noise and emissions are disruptive. While space exploration has widely adopted ion propulsion, terrestrial applications, particularly in UAS, remain under-explored due to challenges like atmospheric drag. Nonetheless, the promise of silent operations, zero emissions, and minimized waste offers a tantalizing prospect for green aviation. Advances by organizations like Undefined Technologies  and MIT  have proven the viability of IPS for Earth-bound applications.   This project aims to develop a sustainable alternative to conventional UAS propulsion mechanisms by integrating ion propulsion systems (IPS), a technology deeply rooted in space exploration, into UAS. This innovative approach promises significant advancements in UAS propulsion, including reduced noise and emissions, enhanced energy efficiency, and increased maneuverability. The project will begin with a comprehensive literature review to assess the current state of the art in ion propulsion systems (IPS) technology and its potential applicability to UAS. This review will inform the development of a specialized sensor system and the integration of a deep learning system directly into the IPS. This innovative approach will ensure that UAS not only benefit from sustainable propulsion but also gain from superior diagnostics and efficiency. In addition, the project will incorporate a Multi-Sensor Perception System (MsPs) that uses neuromorphic-computing-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) to provide real-time feedback on the performance of the IPS and develop advanced diagnostic and predictive maintenance algorithms.   The successful integration of IPS into UAS is expected to have a profound impact on UAS applications across multiple sectors. By significantly reducing noise and emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency and maneuverability, IPS-powered UAS will open up new possibilities for UAS operations in residential zones and other environmentally sensitive areas. This project has the potential to revolutionize the UAS industry by addressing the key limitations of traditional UAS propulsion mechanisms. The successful integration of IPS into UAS will herald a new era of sustainable, efficient, and maneuverable UAS operations.   In addition to the aforementioned benefits, IPS-powered UAS could also offer significant advantages in terms of cost and safety. IPS systems are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and operate, and they pose a lower risk of fire or explosion than traditional UAS propulsion systems. These factors make IPS an attractive option for a wide range of UAS applications, including commercial deliveries, disaster relief, and environmental monitoring.      A comprehensive literature review will be conducted to assess the current state of the art in ion propulsion systems, UAS technologies, and neuromorphic computing. This review will identify key advancements in each area and highlight potential synergies. The review will also identify any gaps in the current knowledge base that need to be addressed.   Upon completion of the literature review, the team will develop a detailed design for downscaling the IPS to operate on UAS and for modifying the UAS to work with the IPS. They will also develop a prototype for the MsPs, which will be based on sensors developed at GRC for the Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) , such as the Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA), planar probe (PP), Discharge current sensor, and Wide-Angle Potential Analyzer (WAPA). The MsPs will be designed to integrate neuromorphic computing principles and ensure compatibility with the IPS. Key metrics for this phase include the design's adaptability, energy efficiency, and compatibility with UAS structures.   Concurrently, a deep learning core will be implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This core will be responsible for analyzing data from the MsPs and optimizing and diagnosing the performance of the ion propulsion system. The efficiency and accuracy of the core, along with its speed and energy efficiency, will be critical.   Once the MsPs and the deep learning core have been developed, they will be integrated and tested in controlled environments to ensure system stability and accuracy. Field testing will then be conducted using UAS equipped with the developed system in real-world conditions to gather pertinent data. Based on the field test insights, refinements will be made to the system to enhance efficiency and address any identified gaps.   Upon completion of the field testing, comprehensive documentation detailing the project, methodologies, and findings will be prepared for various stakeholders. This documentation will include recommendations for future research based on the project's results.   The project's success will be evaluated based on factors such as innovation, tangible impacts, efficiency, feedback from stakeholders, and scalability. An expert panel will be assembled for a holistic evaluation, with feedback recorded for future reference and ongoing refinement.      Upon successful prototyping and validation in UAS, this technology has the potential to be scaled for broader applications, such as larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and piloted aircraft. As the neuromorphic-based DNN control system proves its worth, efforts would be directed towards enhancing its computational prowess, response times, and adaptability, with potential extensions into other aerospace or ground-based vehicular systems.   The broader ecosystem in which UAS operate will also be refined, with emphasis on optimized flight paths, charging facilities, and the incorporation of renewable energy resources, which could play a significant role in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) development. The shift towards sustainability might also lead to explorations in other green aviation facets like sustainable materials, advanced traffic management, and contrail management, possibly resulting in partnerships with industries centered on green airport infrastructure.   As the system evolves, there would be opportunities to leverage richer training datasets to refine the DNN's diagnostic accuracy, making it suitable for commercial UAS maintenance and predictive services. The energy efficiency of ion propulsion paves the way for potential alliances with the renewable energy sector, emphasizing solar, wind, or other green energy sources, culminating in a fully green UAS operation.   Subsequent research could delve into alternative ion propulsion techniques, advanced energy storage solutions, revamped safety protocols, and integration with emerging technologies like quantum computing. Additionally, considering the societal and regulatory implications of such technological advancements would be crucial.   Ultimately, this venture marks the onset of an evolutionary phase in green aviation and computational paradigms, paving the way for a sustainable aerospace future.         Should technical infeasibility be encountered, a thorough review meeting will be convened with all stakeholders to understand the root causes of the challenges, pinpoint impacted project components, and re-evaluate the project's overall feasibility. Following this, there will be a realignment of objectives, potentially modifying certain facets of the approach to ensure project viability. If ion propulsion as a core technology proves untenable, parallel technologies or alternative energy sources, such as electrohydrodynamic (EHD) propulsion or hybrid systems, could be explored to maintain the commitment to green aviation. Regardless of propulsion setbacks, the potential of the Multi-Sensor Perception System (MsPs) and its neuromorphic-computing-based DNN remains significant  pivoting attention to these systems could enhance other green aviation technologies.   To address challenges, collaborations with academic institutions or industry experts may offer fresh perspectives, and iterative prototyping could lead to gradual refinements. If the team identifies knowledge gaps, short-term training or even onboarding temporary experts will be prioritized. Maintaining transparency with all stakeholders, including the funding agency, is crucial to ensure trust and potentially gain additional insights or resources.   In conclusion, while technical challenges are formidable, they can spur innovation. With flexibility, collaboration, and unwavering commitment, the team remains dedicated to the vision of sustainable UAS propulsion, regardless of the path taken.

Design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for composite conformal tanks,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   INSTRUCTIONS   Please do not include your name or other contact information in this form or in the file name.   Please limit the submission to 3 pages with 11 pt font or bigger.   Answer the questions below. Requested resources will be addressed in the form submission and do not need to be addressed in this template.    RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW   Title  Design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for composite conformal tanks   Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.    As aviation moves to new propulsion technologies, fuels as well as airframes there will be a need to restructure the layout. The current tube and wing design has fuel tanks conveniently located in the wings taking advantage of the available volume as well as providing additional structural support. For airframes such as truss braced wings and blended wing bodies  propulsion systems such as high voltage hybrid electric and fuel cells   as well as fuels such as hydrogen, it may no longer be feasible or desirable to maintain the current configuration. Conformal storage tanks are a potential solution as they can increase the packing efficiency in the available volume for odd shaped volumes. For maximum weight efficiency they need to be integrated with the airframe s load carrying paths. This however poses design and manufacturing challenges. Odd shaped conformal tanks are not as amenable to conventional automated composite layup approaches as simpler geometries. This necessitates design compromises or the use of hand layup procedures which impact throughput, product consistency and ultimately the cost of new aircraft and transition to greener aviation.   We therefore propose investigating manufacturing approaches for the design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for conformal tanks to provide both the structural support, fuel holding capacity and slosh prevention while meeting the constraints of the volume available in the new airframes. We propose utilizing high performance carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers as the primary reinforcement for the conformal tanks. Highly flexible, high strength CNT fibers with tight bend radii and high knot efficiency are amenable to automated 3D weaving into complex geometries. These geometries can be optimized for both the fuel carrying, and load path requirements for the conformal tanks. 3D weaving also enables building the structural supports for slosh prevention baffles in the preforms. CNT fibers are macroscopic materials assembled from a hierarchical arrangement of nanotubes.  While still in development, they are now available in lengths and strengths that have enabled demonstration of lined and linerless pressure vessels as well as structural panels for the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Game Changing Office and other customers  1 .      Conformal tanks have a long history of use as a space saving design. In automotives, conformal tanks are used to store windshield-washer fluid and over-flow coolant from radiators  2 . They have also long been considered for spacecraft for their potential weight savings, volume use optimization and placement flexibility  2-5 . Aircraft, specifically military aircraft, have also used conformal tanks for extension of their range and more flexibility in mounting other payloads.  Manufacturing challenges have thus far limited their wider usage in aircraft (and spacecraft) applications.      3D weaving of fibers has started to gain wider use as an enabling technology for creating complex shapes. An example is the Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) where, in partnership with industry, NASA has been developing Thermal Protection System (TPS) technology to enable landing of large payloads on other planets  6 .      Combined, 3D weaving of CNT preforms for conformal composite tanks could lead to manufacturing friendly lightweight structures that integrate well into the airframe for greater performance and reduced environmental impact.      Specifically, we propose to investigate    Achieving the benefits of conformal tanks and structure in green aviation using Systems Analysis   Approaches to the design and manufacturing of structural preforms made from 3D weaving of CNTs for tailored conformal tanks that meet the airframe requirements.    Testing that would be required to support future article fabrication and evaluation.

Mission-Optimal Aircraft Trajectories and Simulation Studies with Contrail Mitigation,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS   TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT   FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL    Title  Mission-Optimal Aircraft Trajectories and Simulation Studies with Contrail Mitigation      Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).

Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.    Problem and Objectives     Air traffic is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming due to the formation of contrails via aircraft emissions. Contrails typically occur at or above 20,000 ft above ground level (AGL) and constitute about 35  of aviation s global warming effects  1 . As the aviation industry continues to grow, the need for efficient contrail mitigation strategies may be required for greater environmental sustainability. Over the years, many contrail mitigation strategies have been developed which involve both heading and altitude changes  2 . These works often provide trade-off values between fuel consumption and contrail reduction. However, to the authors  best knowledge, there is very little research over the impact of widespread adoption of such strategies on a network-wide, large-scale operation  existing works only consider strategies for a single flight. For instance, contrail mitigation strategies may lead to greater air traffic density especially with existing ATC (air traffic control) instructions such as holding, flow control, and demand-capacity balancing  3 .Thus, the objective of this proposed study is to gain a better understanding of the effects of adopting any given contrail mitigation strategy on an existing airspace network. The specific aims of this study are the following    Develop a novel and efficient contrail mitigation strategy based on recent artificial intelligence and search-based techniques for simultaneous flights, rather than just one.   Examine the aggregate impact a given contrail mitigation strategy would have on an existing airspace network within a simulated environment. Impacts can be measured in the form of sector demand or departure delay and will be assessed by comparing the use and lack of use of a mitigation strategy.   Approach     In the field of Air Traffic Control (ATC) most mission-planning can be classified as either strategic or tactical which is linked to either pre-flight or during flight optimization. Our work will focus on investigating pre-flight or strategic flight optimizations in which we seek to create an optimal flight trajectory for a jet-based aircraft while avoiding creating a contrail as it flies from one airport to another. Tactical or during flight optimization will be a support role in our investigation and might become more relevant when last minute maneuvers are needed to avoid flying into a contrail region.   To verify the efficacy of our approach, we will apply it different aircraft-types with different aircraft performance specifications such as (regional aircraft, business jets, commercial aircraft), and new entrants such as supersonic passenger aircraft. We plan on using an open-source flight simulator called BlueSky  4, 4  to model the physics of various aircraft and incorporate Breakthrough Energy's open-source contrail models  5  into BlueSky. Simulating the physics-based contrail models alongside BlueSky's flight simulator allows us to test and refine different trajectory optimization methods and discover which approaches might work or need to be improved to perform contrail avoidance and mitigation per different aircraft and missions.   By comparing different trajectory optimization methods in BlueSky, we will be able to simulate and perform studies on how these new flights will defer from current day-to-day missions. If flights start flying these new mission-optimal routes that avoid regions with high humidity and below freezing temperatures in the airspace that might lead to the creation of contrails  2 , then how much of an impact does this have on flight time, energy use, and other optimization parameters compared to current day-to-day missions? These are some questions we hope to address in our studies.   The novelty of this work is twofold  (1) to design and investigate which trajectory-based optimization methods work for performing contrail avoidance and mitigation per aircraft type and mission profiles  and (2) perform simulation studies for these mission-optimal contrail avoiding aircraft flying in the airspace and how much it would differ or affect the current state-of-the-art aircraft operations. In the second part, we can investigate many different scenarios such as how much extra time these contrail avoiding aircraft will add to their original missions, which aircraft need to avoid contrail regions and which do not, and how will contrail avoidance work with supersonics. Some of these questions have been addressed in prior works but we are proposing an all-encompassing solution metric study and investigate newer aircraft such as supersonics.    Benefits    We advance the state-of-the-art twofold  (1) in flight trajectory optimization by exploring existing and designing new trajectory optimization approaches and incorporate novel contrail avoidance criteria to these methods, and (2) in the ATC realm where we analyze the effect of different missions and aircraft types performing these mission-optimal trajectory-based methods with contrail mitigation. The proposed work will provide several benefits for the public  (1) a contrail model add-on to BlueSky for enabling others to perform contrail detection and avoidance, (2) identify mission-optimal aircraft trajectory optimization methods with contrail avoidance and mitigation, and (3) provide a metric study which analyzes the effects of each different contrail avoidance method.

What follow-on research do you anticipate?    Next steps and Follow-on research    The adoption of contrail mitigation strategies is not widespread due to poor understanding of the greater impacts on existing aviation operations. We envision that more investigation in developing these optimal flight trajectories while avoiding contrail regions in the airspace is needed. In addition, it would be a benefit to perform studies on an air traffic management (ATM) system where we can study the aggregate effect of multiple aircraft interacting with each other while avoiding contrails. Other steps are in more research applying machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and using neural networks.       Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    One area where we can always pivot is in using another flight simulation software if BlueSky does not work as intended, and we can then try to integrate Breakthrough Energy s models or create our own python contrail models based on what is currently published by the research community in scientific journals. The second is related to research and is naturally addressed due to the set-up of the proposal, we aim to investigate several methods for performing trajectory optimization while avoiding creating contrail. We may have to experiment with combining and mixing different flight optimization strategies and possibly consider hypothetical aircraft flight performance specifications to enable certain flight maneuvers. These in turn may provide data or insight into the design of newer aircraft types.     ",,,,,,

RESPOND TO PROMPTS BELOW Title  Direct Measurement of Charge Transport Mechanisms in Electric Engine Cabling for Coronal Discharge Mitigation and Current Mapping 1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant)  What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?

Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate. Aircraft have traditionally used 28 volts for power distribution, but newer aircraft are beginning to use 270 volts. The first all-electric aircraft are using voltages of up to about 500  however, designers who are looking at megawatt-class electrified-propulsion systems for single-aisle airliners propose up to 3,000 volts and up to 2000 amps. At such high currents, buckles in cabling and defects in the conductor material can cause unwanted heat sinks that can destroy cables. Also, high voltages in the reduced air pressure at the cruising altitudes of commercial aircraft could lead to a potentially hazardous phenomenon known as partial discharge. Partial discharge occurs when a current breaches the gap between two points with a voltage differential across or through an insulation (micron level or smaller in size). These gaps, or voids, are typically air bubbles within the wire s insulation that occur during wire cable fabrication. The voltage differential between the two points creates an electric field inside the gap polarizing the air molecules within. As the electric field grows stronger, the molecules within the insulation gap are more apt to collide and ionize, that is, to become either positively or negatively charged due to the loss or gain of an electron, respectively. Mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before experiencing a collision (i.e., the average distance any air molecule in the insulation gap will travel before hitting another.) At high altitudes (low-pressure), despite fewer collisions, the longer mean free path allows the particles to accelerate over a greater distance and collide with significantly greater kinetic energy. These higher energy collisions are more likely to facilitate ionization. So new cabling designs and insulation systems will have to be developed to avoid such hazards. Current state-of-the-art for high-current measurement breaking the circuit or magnetic induction (NDG.io). Breaking the circuit at such high currents can add unwanted high failure connection points. Magnetic induction technology measures the induced current produced by the magnetic field generated  from cable current. While this a much better way, the induction method is too inaccurate (not greater than 2 , 40 amp difference at 2000 amps) for aircraft precision, much too bulky to get between cabling, and are only rated up to 600 amps. Much less than many MW aircraft are projected to require. Even if all these issues for both methods could be solved, both approaches average out spatial variations and therefore cannot distinguish the contributions of bulk processes and edge effects or defect-induced contributions, which are of crucial importance to understanding local current densities in the cabling at different points. Current state-of-the-art detection of partial coronal discharge utilize micro-sonics. One technique uses a mini network of micro-acoustic cameras to digitally visualize the minute vibrations from breaking the insulation (Flir). These devices allow a spatial imaging of the conductor and where the breaking is occurring visually. Another technique uses opto-acoustic imaging through fiber optic cabling (Optics11). These devices detect the acoustic emission signals of partial discharges and tracks their evolution over time with fiber optic partial discharge (PD) sensors. The measuring principle behind the fiber optic PD sensor is based on the acoustic emission technology. Both technologies are a bit expensive yet work well at detecting partial discharges in high-voltage environments. However, both technologies require microvibrations of an insulation breach or beginnings of the discharge to have anything to detect. By this time the cable would already be compromised and in need in need of replacement. This may be fine for an electrical ground station but not an aircraft 30,000 ft in the air full of passengers. This project aims to create very low SWaP, nano micro scale magnetic field sensor to measure these minute magnetic fields and field gradients created by the moving charges in aircraft cabling using ionic defects in Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices as atomic-scale magnetometers. These sensors would be able to detect currently accurately, but also determine current vector and deliver spatial current density measurements. This would allow for accurate hot-spot detection in conductors well before an issue is created. In high-voltage situation these sensors could measure buildup of charge due to voids or points in high voltage insulation via their minute magnetic field gradients produced through moving charges. This would allow for detection of an incurring PD well before it has begun and will allow for diagnosis of what stage it is in well before the breach. This technology works by using the electronic resonance of an electron of an implanted defect in a biased-SiC device as an absolute magnetometer. The magnetic fields are measured as a perturbation of the electronic resonance of the system where magnetic field intensity, vector, and current density can be derived. This work is early TRL, however, we have built an initial quantum magnetometry apparatus and have demonstrated the ability to achieve resonance. An acceptance from this call would allow for completion to the next steps in device realization for future clean, green aviation systems monitoring. 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 1. Charge transport models will be produced in COMSOL. 2. Characterization of Defects will be done using Electrically Detected Magnetic Resonance (EDMR) spectroscopy. 3. Device sensitivity will be determined experimentally, and the theoretical limit will be determined through modeling. 4. Demonstration of minute magnetic field measurement via defects in SiC will be completed. This work should be evaluated based on whether the system has the capability to measure minute changes in magnetic fields, needed sensitivities are determined to measure precursors of partial discharge and current density in conductors, and device theoretical sensitivity has been determined to be able to meet these requirements when full device is realized. 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? The next steps would be to optimize efficiency, speed, and sensitivity. Then, the miniaturization of the non-chip laboratory components to chip-scale would come next. Some of this work would be done in tandem. As of right now, we are adding a preamp on chip which would eliminate the need for off chip preamplification. The most reasonable transition for this work would be to be absorbed into a larger project focused on electric engines and magnetic materials. The continuance of this work would not require huge amounts of capital to continue so it would not burden a large or medium program at all. Continued work in understanding the manifestation of partial discharge could be done. Also, understanding of generation and dynamics of magnetic domain walls at nano scale in nanocrystalline metal (NSM) materials could be done with these devices. These materials are essential to switching in electric engines. Because of the much larger power and rate that would be needed for electric aviation than cars, new more efficient switching materials are much needed for future aviation. 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? With 9 months still available, there would be much time to pivot. Each milestone has a contingency if not providing results in a reasonable amount of time. The only real possibilities of issue would be milestones 3 and 4. Characterization of the defect type would be initially done by Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) analysis. The RTS is characterized by a well-defined current amplitude between the high and low level and the average times in the high and low levels following a Poissonian distribution. Spectroscopic information about the defect responsible for the observed RTS is usually extracted by observing the dependence of the capture and emission time constants on temperature. If that has issues, we will do to another method. The onset of RTS with increasing forward bias is accompanied by the onset of electroluminescence (EL). We would employ a method to use photonics to observe the luminescent response with change in bias. If there is an issue with this method, we would employ deeplevel transient spectroscopy (DTLS). This would require an augmentation of our setup so this would be the last step to employ if all fails. We need to be able to demonstrate the measurement of minute magnetic fields to calibrate detector, demonstrate principle, and find theoretical limits to complete this year s work. So, we will apply three methods to ascertain the needed parameters. If one fails or does not work, we can average it out. The lock-in output of the spin resonance signal is approximately the first derivative of the Lorentzian or Gaussian broadened lineshape, which provides a linear response between the signal amplitude and magnetic field near resonance. As such, the sensitivity of an EDMR-based sensor is proportional to the signal linewidth and amplitude. The first method assumes an electrical shot-noise limited sensitivity, which can be simply calculated using EDMR spectrum. The second method outlined in performs a FFT on the time trace of the lock-in output at the zero-crossing point of the spin resonance response. The last method applies a square wave modulated external magnetic field of alternating polarity and a histogram of the lock-in output time trace is used to determine the standard deviation to calculate the sensitivity. These methods would be applied in order.",,,,,,

Obtaining temperature measurements within the high-temperature and high-pressure environments of aviation gas turbine test rigs are extremely challenging due to their harsh environment. Traditional instrumentation such as thermocouple probes do not typically survive within such environments or are limited to wall-based measurements only. Laser-based, nonintrusive measurements are considered to be ideal within such environments and indeed their developments within research laboratories have intensified over the past 2-3 decades. Nevertheless, quantitative measurements within such environments often create their own challenges. An example of such a measurement challenge would be solid tracer particles introduced into the flow for particle imaging velocimetry or phosphor thermography fouling windows, thereby limited the life of the experimental hardware and reducing the utility of such measurements. Molecular-based measurements on the other hand, especially those that rely on the gas-phase spectroscopic properties of targeted species, are ideally suited for such environments as they do not require a physical probe or tracer particles. Among the different measurement tools available within this category, the proposed work would develop high-speed (10-100 kHz), spatially resolved, 2D planar temperature measurements of specific targeted molecules using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). The targeted molecules would primarily be flame gas radicals naturally present within the combustion chamber and downstream sections of alternative propulsion systems for aviation. Such measurements can provide particularly rich insight within the flame zone, as different radicals such as OH for hydrogen-air propulsion systems or NH for ammonia-air propulsion systems can be targeted. Temperature measurements within such environments have the potential to provide crucial insight into the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and other key pollutants, especially in terms of their spatial distribution and temporal evolution. Furthermore, the NO molecule can also be directly targeted for measurements of temperature and perhaps concentration using planar laser-induced  fluorescence if enough NO were to be present in the flame gas (  100 ppm). These temperature measurements would be used by engine designers and combustion engineers performing CFD simulations. Time-resolved measurements would enable the validation of modern computer codes, such as large eddy simulations (LES). The proposed work leverages recent developments in burst-mode laser and optical parametric oscillator technology, including those supported by recent NASA SBIR and NSTGRO awards, to facilitate such a temperature measurement at high repetition-rates. The state-of-the-art for such measurements, especially within harsh practical environments, requires using two complex laser systems simultaneously while being limited to a repetition-rate of 10 Hz. In contrast, the proposed work utilizes the wavelength flexibility of the burst-mode laser with the wavelength tunability of the optical parametric oscillator to provide a two-wavelength temperature measurement at 1,000-10,000 times the standard repetition rate. This proposal heavily leverages the state-of-the-art laser and camera systems recently acquired by researchers in the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch within the NASA Langley Research Directorate. By utilizing the recent technology investments already undertaken by NASA, the current proposal can provide critical support to improve the TRL of this measurement technology so that it can be applied within areas of critical ARMD needs such as green aviation. NASA programs supporting the next generation designs of gas turbine engines, along with government collaborators such as the Department of Energy and industry partners such as General Electric, would benefit from this temperature measurement tool development. 2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. The primary objectives of the proposal research is to demonstrate spatially resolved, 2D planar temperature measurements of selected species at a repetition-rate of 10-100 kHz for burst durations of 2-10 ms. Nominal field-of-view for the 2D measurement plane is approximately 100 mm x 100 mm, with a typical spatial resolution on the order of 0.1 mm. This effort strongly leverages recent SBIR efforts supported by researchers in the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch at NASA Langley. The first task for the project would be to complete a literature review on two-line temperature measurements for candidate molecules within flames such as OH, NH, and NO. Based on this literature review, one molecule will be down selected for the Year 1 investigation. Work in the laboratory will be performed for the rest of the year, with the key intermediary reporting milestones being characterization of the measurement sub-systems and initial temperature measurements. An end-of-year report would provide a summary of the entire effort for the project, including data for high-speed temperature measurements with estimated uncertainties within a labscale environment. The end of year report would also provide an evaluation of the measurement capability for optically accessible combustion test rigs and the proposed way forward to further develop this research for deployment within an engine-relevant configuration. A summary of the anticipated milestones is provided in the table below. Month Task Milestone 3 Summarize literature review supporting down-selection of target flame radial (OH, NO, or NH) for Year 1 investigation. Slide Package 6 Report performance of measurement sub-systems, particularly laser system, for Year 1 investigation. Slide Package 9 Report initial thermometry measurements of a down-selected flame radical using the high-speed laser system. Slide Package 12 Summarize temperature measurements with estimated uncertainties and propose way forward to further develop research. Report 3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? The proposed research effort is highly crosscutting as it focuses on the measurement tool development for high-speed temperature measurements within alternative propulsion systems. Following successful Year 1 demonstration efforts, Year 2  efforts may focus on the further development of the tool through application within increasingly realistic environments relevant to the combustor or downstream sections of an alternative propulsion system. The grand challenge of such development efforts would be a demonstration of such measurements within an optically accessible gas turbine test rig at the Glenn Research Center operating with hydrogen-air, ammonia-air, or another alternative aviation fuel. The windowed test rigs at Glenn are well suited for these measurements, as optical access from two orthogonal windows are typically required for PLIF. Indeed, researchers such as R.J. Locke and Y.R. Hicks from Glenn have performed laser-based measurements within such facilities over the years. However, neither high-speed PLIF flow visualization nor PLIF thermometry has been performed at these facilities to the best of my knowledge. The work could also be extended in future years to study contrail formation in sooting flames, which would utilize other laser-based diagnostics methods such as laser-induced incandescence (LII) while leveraging the same burst-mode laser system. 4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? The planned effort of detailed literature review and down-selection of the target flame molecule provides a perfect opportunity to evaluate the technical feasibility of the proposed approach. For the proposed effort we plan to use a two-wavelength thermometry approach for 10-100 kHz temperature measurements. Such an approach requires two laser wavelengths to be carefully selected and may limit the dynamic range of the measurement. In the event that this approach would be deemed not technically feasible, one potential pivot would be to incorporate a four-wavelength thermometry approach. Such an approach would leverage the developments in burst-mode laser architecture recently performed by an NSTGRO Fellow who is part of the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch at NASA Langley. In short, the alternative approach would modify the laser architecture to provide a group of four laser pulses at four different wavelengths, rather than a pair of laser pulses at two different wavelengths, while maintaining the overall measurement repetitionrate of 10-100 kHz. Two different measurement schemes could be utilized based on this approach  1) a four-line temperature measurement probing four different absorption transitions or 2) a fourcolor temperature measurement where two of the laser wavelengths correspond to the peak of two different transitions and the other two wavelengths are slightly detuned from their respective peaks. The flexibility of the laser system that we propose to use in this work enables one to easily pivot towards more technically feasible approaches as the need potentially arises.",,,,,,

Electrification of aircraft is critical to achieve this goal. A key component for electric aviation, if not the most important one, is the energy storage device that is not only capable of powering the aircraft (i.e., high energy, high power), but also safe to fly. LI-air batteries are widely considered the most energy-dense energy storage platform yet the most challenging to develop. A Li-air battery pack has potential to achieve ultrahigh specific energy  1000 Wh kg that is unattainable with any other battery chemistry. Successful development would be transformational and may enable 737-type short haul or even long haul electric aircraft.   While NASA has several previous projects on Li-air batteries, they ended with either the lack of required performance metrics or transition opportunities. There has been recent refocus on aviation batteries, with substantial development in energy storage materials and deeper understanding in safe, high energy battery concepts. We herein propose, as a seedling effort, the re-invention toward a new generation of Li-air batteries. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of combined use of solid electrolyte with holey graphene air cathode for high specific energy Li-oxygen batteries and to project a credible path toward the full development of a 1000 Wh kg battery pack. The key aspects of our approach are    Explore the use of solid electrolyte instead of conventional liquid electrolyte in the battery cells. As such, the Li-air batteries will become non-flammable.   With the use of oxygen from Earth atmosphere as the cathodic reactant, Li-air batteries are intrinsically the most sustainable option among all battery platforms.    With our proven holey graphene air cathode platform (developed by PI) ultrahigh specific energy beyond 1000 Wh kg at the pack level may be achievable.       Successful execution of this seedling project would be the first step toward the most disruptive solution and the holy grail for aviation batteries that may enable 737-type large aircraft with all-electric propulsion, for which no other solutions currently exist.    Background    Recently, our team has been investigating a solid-state lithium-sulfur battery system in the CAS TTT project  SABERS  ( Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety ), which may enable a non-flammable battery system with specific energy of 500 Wh kg. If successful, SABERS could enable safe battery packs that can power commuter-level vehicles. With low-cost elemental sulfur as the active cathodic reactant, SABERS is also considered a sustainable solution in comparison to state-of-the-art Li ion chemistries where expensive transition metal oxides are used, along with their serious supply chain risks.    SABERS team has made significant progress and recently demonstrated experimentally a feasible path to achieve the above goals. However, larger future vehicles, such as 737-type electric aircraft, would require much higher specific energy at 1000 Wh kg level, with equal (if not higher) requirement in the safety and rechargeability, among other criteria. While conventional lithium-ion chemistry has a specific energy limit in the vicinity of 300 Wh kg, the use of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) chemistry in SABERS could double that amount. We recently projected that SABERS bipolar solid-state battery stacks may achieve around 700 Wh kg with perfect S utilization, but practically in the range of 550-600 Wh kg considering the realistic kinetic electrochemical efficiency in terms of S conversion. While this surpasses the goal of SABERS, the gap toward 1000 Wh kg for future aviation remains substantial. The lithium-sulfur chemistry is therefore at its limit.   Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) electrochemistry is also known as  Li-air batteries  as the oxygen is expected to be spontaneously extracted from air. Li-O2 battery system has an extraordinary high theoretical specific energy ( 12000 Wh kg). There have been significant research efforts in the area at about a decade ago, but both fundamental obstacles with regard to fully realizing the high-energy chemistry and the grim perspective in developing a useful battery pack due to the use of gas for cathode resulted in diminished interest. Near-term investments have turned to battery technology with mid-range specific energy but with reduced cost (e.g. DOE s Battery 500 Consortium) or enhanced safety (e.g. NASA s SABERS).   That being said, Li-O2 electrochemistry remains to be the holy grail of battery chemistry with the highest potentially achievable specific energy among all battery platforms. In addition, since the cathodic reactant comes directly from the air atmosphere, it is an intrinsically sustainable concept. In essence, despite formidable challenges, Li-air batteries are a reluctant but inevitable choice for future green electric aviation.   Fundamental obstacles for Li-O2 batteries include the sluggish discharge and charge reaction kinetics, the lack of cathodic capacity, and a plethora of issues plagued with Li metal anode, such as dendrite formation during large capacity or high rate charge discharge as well as oxygen shuttling from cathodic compartment. If directly harvesting O2 from air, the moisture and CO2, as well as the low partial pressure of O2, are among critical challenges.   NASA has previously invested in Li-air O2 battery chemistry. For example, CAS supported the LION project, which focused on the fundamental issues with the liquid electrolyte. PI earned  4 years of IRAD support from NASA LaRC to investigate holey graphene, a novel carbon nanomaterial developed by PI at LaRC, for air cathode in Li-O2 batteries. Significant progress was made. For instance, it was demonstrated that holey graphene based air cathode may achieve areal capacities  50 mAh cm2 (in comparison to typical Li-ion batteries  2 mAh cm2). A small format pouch cell ( 100 mAh) was successfully demonstrated. In related efforts, Lin also investigated Li-CO2 and Li-CO2 O2 battery chemistries for space applications. It is encouraging that the same holey graphene air cathode platform allows the partial contamination of CO2 in O2 without significantly reduced performance.   In summary, building from both liquid-electrolyte Li-O2 (and CO2) battery and solid-state Li-S battery experiences, it is a great timing to start tackling solid-state Li-air batteries, which might be the toughest problem in aviation batteries. If successful, it could provide a sustainable, transformative, and ultimate energy storage solution for future aerospace.      Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.   Month 3  Identify one or more solid-electrolytes suitable for Li-air O2 batteries   Month 6  Develop methodologies to prepare solid-state air cathode with holey graphene platform and an identified solid-electrolyte   Month 12  Demonstrate solid-state Li-O2 battery cell performance and project the path to achieve 1000 Wh kg      After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    It is envisioned that, with this seedling effort successfully demonstrating the feasibility and path at the battery materials level, a larger investment from ARMD could follow for a longer term effort with regard to fundamental science incorporated with both experiments and modeling, scale-up engineering, and, eventually, flight demonstration. This will be a collaborative effort across multiple Centers to take advantage of different NASA internal expertise (e.g., LaRC   battery materials, GRC   Agency lead in power and energy, ARC   battery modeling, and AFRC   flight demonstration). Involvement of academic, industrial, and other government lab partners could further strengthen the NASA-led effort.   Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    The first key step of the proposed work is to identify a suitable solid electrolyte. The basic requirement is that it is non-flammable. In addition, it will need to be stable within the voltage range ( 2   4.5V) without decomposition. It will also need to be stable against prolonged exposure to oxygen. If the subject matter expert determines that this is not feasible technically, we could pivot to various non-flammable liquid electrolytes as alternatives. The followed cathode fabrication and cell tests, as well as specific energy projection, could then be adjusted accordingly. ",,,,,,

Please include references citations to back up claims where appropriate.       A major goal of the ARMD SIP is enabling safe, quiet, and efficient vertical lift vehicles technologies in strategic thrust 4. In order to reduce the environmental footprint of this soon to be expansive field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles, research into novel propulsion methodologies is needed. The traditional way of designing propellers through Minimum Induced Loss (MIL) was created by Betz in 1921 and has not changed to this day  1 . There is a new propeller design, proposed in NASA TM 20210014683, which optimizes based on the minimization of torque instead of MIL  2 . We received CIF IRAD funding last FY to perform an initial proof-of-concept on this novel propeller design, and computational results from this funding have shown that the new design provides the same amount of thrust with a 2-3  reduction in torque (and thus a 2-3  reduction in power consumption) when compared to a modern (MIL) propeller with all the same characteristics except blade twist. Another highly desired quality is a reduction in noise due to the unique loading of the propeller. The Angle of Attack (AOA) at the tip of the propeller tapers off which substantially reduces the tip loading and large shear layer intensity and thus noise generation  3 . We were awarded 2nd year CIF IRAD funding and have 3D printed these propellers out of titanium and plan to test them in the Low-Speed Acoustic Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at Langley in Q1 FY24 in order to gather efficiency and acoustic data at the full range of advance ratios. Using TTT funding, we could extend our research by placing our novel (denoted  Prandtl ) and baseline (MIL) propellers onto an actual quadcopter, or fixed-wing subscale vehicle and compare the energy used during flight as well as the acoustic signatures between propeller designs. This could give us real-world evidence for the effective reduction in energy used in addition to acoustic noise generation which are two major improvements needed for the budding UAM field. This real-world evidence would increase the public and industry s confidence in this new technology which would help it be implemented in real-world UAM vehicles. In the 2030-2040s timeframe, the use of VTOL vehicles in urban environments will rapidly increase and will become a large transportation industry with potentially large adverse effects to the environment in the future. The Aviation Climate Action Plan s goal of reducing aircraft emissions by 2  each year for net carbon zero by 2050 could be realized in part by the 2  or greater reduction in energy use shown in our novel propeller design vs traditional MIL in vehicles designed for the growing field of UAM.       1  Betz, A.,  Airscrews with minimum energy loss,  Report, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research, 1919.    2  Bowers, A.

In order to test this novel propeller design on a real-world sub-scale vehicle, we anticipate four major milestones    Fabricate multiple clockwise and counterclockwise Prandtl and MIL propellers out of carbon-fiber layups for low weight, high rigidity, and high strength propeller blades   Procure COTS quadcopter fixed-wing vehicle and outfit with Prandtl propellers and baseline MIL propellers   Obtain Airworthiness Review Board (ARB) and Operational Readiness Review (ORR) approvals for vehicle airworthiness statements and operational reviews for flight testing   Flight test vehicle with novel Prandtl and baseline MIL propellers to gain data for energy used       After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?    The team working on Prandtl Propeller (this novel propeller design) is also working on the RAVEN SWFT eVTOL sub-scale concept vehicle. One potential extension of the RAVEN SWFT vehicle that has been a goal of the team is for the vehicle to be used as an eVTOL technology testbed for efficiency and acoustic research as well as the controls research it is currently being used for. Next steps for Prandtl Propeller after testing on a COTS vehicle is testing on the experimental eVTOL RAVEN SWFT vehicle which emulates future people-carrying eVTOL vehicles in future UAM environments. Another next step is fabricating large-scale versions of Prandtl propellers and gathering experimental data to determine the scalability and feasibility of this propeller design on the scale of manned vehicles.       Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation   Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?    Our initial proposal is to test our new Prandtl Propellers on a quadcopter or fixed-wing subscale airplane model. The current Prandtl and baseline MIL propeller was designed for an advance ratio of 0.4 which means the propellers will perform better in a forward-flight or fixed-wing airplane configuration. If we test the Prandtl and MIL propellers on a quadcopter and find that the data doesn t represent our analysis due to the quadcopter s propellers operating in a static (no forward velocity) configuration, then we can easily pivot to a fixed-wing aircraft. Ultimately, this issue would be solved by adding variable pitch to the propeller (a feature of the RAVEN SWFT model) which would allow for the propeller to be adjusted to optimize for static (hover) and forward-flight for different flight phases of VTOL vehicles in UAM, and this would be possible avenues for expansion in the future. Another potential roadblock would be not obtaining airworthiness approval from the ARB (unlikely). In this case, we could pivot our focus towards designing Prandtl and baseline MIL propellers for the static case which would benefit the UAM community by giving them a static (hover) as well as dynamic (forward-flight) high-efficient propeller design. In the future, we could compare the effectiveness of using the static designed propeller or dynamic designed propeller on a VTOL vehicle with its own ARB approval such as the RAVEN SWFT.  ",,,,,,
Sustainability and Connected Autonomy  A New Era for Aviation (Carnegie Mellon U),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2022 - ""Airports of Tomorrow""",,"1 Introduction In response to the increasing threat of climate change, NASA has declared that it aims to cut carbon emissions by half by 2050 compared to 2005, and achieve net zero emissions in 2060. Tomeet this goal, airports, airlines, and other organizations in the aviation industry will have to reduce emissions in a major way. Our paper focuses on how airports can be designed to support future changes in the aviation industry with a specific emphasis on two themes  airport sustainability and autonomy. Each theme is tied to our airport innovations and guided our final design of the airport. To start, we modeled our initial concepts on the Denver International Airport. The new technologies we describe center around changes in aircraft formand fuel type, gate design, urban airmobility (UAM), storing multiple fuel types, and autonomous systems. Even though our concepts are applied to the Denver International Airport, we believe the designs can be generalized to other airports as well. 2 2050 Aviation Landscape In 2050, we anticipate many changes to aircraft formand energy sources. We expect sustainable aviation fuel to be the largest proportion of the fleet followed by lesser proportions of hydrogen, ammonia, battery powered electric aircraft. We also expect aircraft formto adapt to new on-broad fuel storage requirements where one possible change is to a blended-wing body design. It is also likely that we will see supersonic commercial aircraft in the future. To support these aircraft, airports will require infrastructure changes in their gate design, aprons, and fueling and baggage loading. Societal changes and attitudes toward flying may also have an impact on our airport design. If flying becomes cheaper and more accessible, then total air travel is likely to increase and in turn increase the urgency for sustainable aircraft  29 . Similarly, increases in the cost of jet fuel may make alternative fuel sources more attractive and speed up the transition. Expedited changes to sustainable aircraft may drive faster development of fuel storage locations, more aircraft operations vehicles, and expansive terminal layouts. If however, sustainable aircraft technology becomes costly to develop or support, then air travel will increase in cost and drive compromises to airport upgrades e.g. only supporting battery-electric aircraft and not hydrogen fuel. 3 Future Aircraft Fuel Sources and Design 3.1 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a carbon emission friendly alternative to jet fuel. SAF is similar in chemical composition to jet fuel, but, as opposed to requiring the extraction of new hydrocarbons, is manufactured fromrecycled carbonmaterials  22, 67, 55 . As a result, even though SAF generates CO2 during combustion, it is not adding more net CO2 to the environment  22 . SAF is also considered a ""drop-in"" fuel that can be mixed with jet fuel and does not require storage or engine modifications  75, 67, 56, 49 . The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently allows commercial planes to fly with up to a 50  mixture of SAF  22, 56 . Both Los Angeles andMunich airports are currently configured to support SAFmixtures  additionally, several companies including Boeing, Rolls Royce, United Airlines, and General Electric are conducting SAF experiments with higher percentage mixtures  22, 60, 77 . However, there are several hurdles to widespread adoption of SAF. First, the US will need to expand available feedstocks to meet an estimated demand of 35 billion gallons on SAF in 2050  22, 56, 70, 49 . Second, current production of SAF is limited to only a few facilities, but several thousand facilities will be required to meet future demand  22, 70 . Third, the cost per gallon of SAF is higher than jet fuel  while SAF prices may decrease over time, they may never be competitive with jet fuel  22 . 1 Nevertheless, the Biden Administration, the FAA, and the Department of Energy have indicated that SAF will be key to achieving decarbonization goals  22, 55, 54, 70, 13, 33 . Not only does the fuel produce net-zero emissions, but SAF also does not require aircraft updates or significant airport infrastructure changes. As a result, we assume SAF production will increase and fuel a large proportion of the fleet in 2050. 3.2 Hydrogen Fuel Hydrogen fuel, used in either combustion or as an electricity generating fuel cell, does not create CO2 emissions and can be considered a zero-carbon energy source if generated with renewable sources  2, 4, 13 . Hydrogen also contains more energy per kilogram than jet fuel. On the other hand, hydrogen is much less volume dense, up to a factor of 3000 1 when compared with jet fuel at standard temperature and pressure  2 . Pressurizing and cryogenic-cooling hydrogen can reduce volumetric density to a 4 1 ratio, which is more suitable for aviation  2, 13 . Nevertheless, aircraft design changes, such as a new blended wing-body design, are likely needed to accommodate large sophisticated hydrogen storage tanks  2, 13, 33, 46, 40 . Airbus, for example, is developing several hydrogen powered aircraft in their  ZEROe  program scheduled to debut in 2035  2, 5 . ZeroAvia is also developing smaller and shorter range hydrogen fuel cell aircraft with a goal of commercial flights before 2030  33, 78 . Three additional challenges to hydrogen fuel include establishing the required logistics of transporting, storing and distributing hydrogen at the airport  13, 66 , reducing hydrogen generation costs  33 , and public acceptance. While early hydrogen adoption at airports can be supplied with truck deliveries, pipelines will provide more reliable and safe fuel transportation for the long-term  46 . Safe storage of hydrogen is more complicated due to pressurization and cooling requirements and will likely require new infrastructure  65 . For distribution, airport trucks may be the best option over expensive costs to upgrade jet fuel hydrant systems  46 . Hydrogen is also currently several times more expensive than jet fuel and, to have a zero-CO2 lifecycle (""green hydrogen""), will require generation through electrolysis, which is costly and not yet implemented at scale  33, 46 . Finally, the introduction of a new fuel may require long-term engagement with the public to address concerns and reduce hurdles with public acceptance. The pace of hydrogen aircraft development is uncertain. Some believe there will be faster rate of adoption of hydrogen aircraft  46 , but we are more conservative due to the scope of the required technology innovations, likely aircraft design changes, and the subsequent FAA certification process  13, 33 . As a result, we believe hydrogen aircraft may be an emerging fuel source in 2050, but is unlikely to be a significant portion of the fleet. 3.3 Ammonia Fuel Ammonia is another promising fuel source for aviation. Recent developments by Reaction Engines use heat to separate ammonia into an ammonia-hydrogen mixture which can be used for zero-carbon emission combustion in a jet engine  19 . Ammonia is often viewed as an alternative to hydrogen fuel due to its higher density per volume, see Figure 2, and higher boiling point  14, 24, 20 . A higher volumetric density may make it possible to retrofit current aircraft designs  19 . A higher boiling point for liquid ammonia also aids in simplifying fuel storage  14, 38, 20 . Additionally, ammonia production is already well established with 180 million tons produced annually  57, 23, 38, 20 . One disadvantage to ammonia fuel are possible environmental impacts. While ammonia promises zero carbon emissions, it may produce other air pollutants, such as nitrous oxide (NOx)  19, 14 . NOx can have negative environmental impacts and is believed to cause 16,000 premature deaths each year  14, 59 . Even though ammoniamay only produce half as much NOx as jet fuel, hydrogen fuel would not produce any NOx emissions  24 . As a result, given the balance of benefits with environmental challenges 2 of ammonia fuel and the early stage of technology development, we believe ammonia will be adopted in similarmanner to hydrogen fuel. 3.4 Electric Aircraft New advancements in battery technology are expanding to electric aviation. Companies such as Lilium, Kittyhawk, Beta, Archer and Joby Aviation are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOLs) aircraft to serve as short range air taxis  44, 41, 15, 10, 39  and Airbus, Rolls Royce, and Eviation are researching fixed wing electric platforms  3, 62, 27, 42 . Even though electric aircraft produce zeroemissions, batteries have a low energy density relative to traditional fuels sources, see Figure 2  72 . This leads to limited range and payload for future electric aircraft. Markets for electric aircraft still exist however, both in boosting urban mobility and serving short regional flights. Cape Air, for example, operates short range flights in New England and is purchasing Eviation s  Alice  all-electric aircraft for use in their routes  73, 35, 9 . Harbour Air in the Pacific Northwest serves a similar set of short range customers with their battery electric converted seaplanes  25, 32 . One challenge to electric aircraft is developing the required battery recharging infrastructure. Most airports are located near a power grid which can directly supply electricity  however, some airports in more remote locations likely need a local energy source, such as a system of solar panels  7 . Airports near a power grid may still require infrastructure upgrades, however, due to increased peak and total power demand from electric aircraft batteries  76, 43, 37 . Applying a battery-swap paradigm can reduce instantaneous energy demand and improve aircraft turn-around time, but will require a battery storage and charging location  76, 31 . Finally, standardization of charging infrastructure and installation at all airports, similar to passenger boarding bridges, is important for electric aircraft adoption  76 . In summary, even though the electricity grid is accessible at most airports, given the low energy density of near future battery technology, electric aircraft will be part of the near-termdecarbonization solution but may only serve short distance flights. 3.5 Hybrid Electric Aircraft We define hybrid electric aircraft as aircraft that have both batteries and combustible fuel and can implement a variety of different propulsion designs  61 . Specifically, we are interested in three designs  electric propulsion powered by batteries which can be recharged during flight with a fuel powered generator  18 , electric propulsion powered by a gas turbine which can be augmented by batteries during periods of high power demand (e.g. during take-off)  63 , and a mix of both electric and fuel propulsion  63 . Several companies are exploring hybrid electric aircraft including Electra, Embraer, Ampaire, Honeywell, Faradair and Rolls Royce  18, 17, 8, 36, 63, 61 . Early development trajectories indicate that hybrid electric aircraft will fill shorter range regional markets with passenger quantities similar to all electric aircraft  18, 17, 61 . Given the similarities in markets, technologies required and the active prototyping of hybrid electric aircraft today, we believe that hybrid electric aircraft will be adopted on a similar timeframe and in similar proportions to all-electric aircraft  18 . 3.6 Aircraft Form This section will discuss our anticipated aircraft design changes through the year 2050. We primarily considered modifications to traditional commercial airplanes and to Urban AirMobility (UAM) vehicles. Additionally, the form of new aircraft will greatly depend on a newer approach to air travel. We expect commercial airplanes in particular to take an approach made up of high frequency, short distance flights. The planes will likely be more compact and, as a result, more aerodynamic. The changes to formwill likely be supplemented with stronger,more sustainablematerials  50 . 3 The airplane form changes that have the most potential for the 2050 landscape are blended-wing body (BWB) and the strut-braced wing (SBW) designs. The SBWdesign of aircraft does not have many features that lend it to compatibility with the other feasible technologies we have identified, so we will be focusing on the BWB design as our primary advancement in aircraft form. The BWB design is simply a single connected wing with a payload area for passengers and or cargo in the middle. The degree of blending between the wings and body can be manipulated to maximize efficiency and reduce noise pollution, supporting our overall goal. New designs rely on optimizing aerodynamics to reduce single-trip fueling frequency, which enables both long range flying and short range, high frequency flying  51 . The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is further researching the potential of a larger BWB design for passengers with an expected 2040 completion. These larger BWB designs rely primarily on hybrid fueling to support sustainability efforts and long range flying  29 . These designs can also be used for long range cargo transport for areas that cannot be reached by smaller UAMs. NASA and Boeing have already begun working on BWB concepts for commercial usage with the aforementioned qualities. Since BWB aircraft are already in use for military purposes, this may allow commercial airlines to pursue an amend-type certification from the FAA (3-5 years) versus an air-worthiness certification (5-9 years)  28 . In addition to the larger capacity provided by BWB aircraft, supersonic commercial airplanes may also be available. This design will benefit airport operations because passengermovement will flow quicker and the concept of short range, high frequency flying can be realized. However, supersonic aircraft need to overcome their structural and noise issues before mass adoption. On this front, LockheedMartin s X-59 QueSST is a test aircraft being developed to resolve different issues with supersonic aircraft before it can be mass produced for commercial purposes  52 . 4 Airport Innovations 4.1 Design Themes Our proposed innovations to airport design can be summarized by two themes  sustainability and connected autonomy. Sustainability focuses on two initiatives  first, supporting new aircraft through advanced terminal layouts and gate design, vertical landing ports, and centralized fuel storage  second, allowing for expansion of airport technologies and capacity to support increasing aviation demand. Our second theme, connected autonomy, is central to airport operations. We envision autonomous vehicles completing task across the airport such as moving baggage, food, fuel, passengers, etc. Each autonomous vehicle will be connected to a larger network to ensure safe movement and efficient operations. Both of our themes encompass how the airport of the future will adapt to new aircraft designs and increasing demand for air travel. Each of the design innovations supporting our themes is discussed in detail in the following sections with a summary including estimated technology readiness levels (TRLs) provided in Table 1. Our TRL estimates are derived fromNASA definitions as described in the Appendix, Figure 3. 4.1.1 Remote Pier Terminal Layout After researching the differentmodels for airport tarmac and terminal configurations, we believe that the remote pier (also called concourse) design would be the ideal model for airports of the future. The remote pier design maximizes apron use, as compared to pier and satellite designs, with arriving planes spending less time on the ground taxiing, waiting to refuel, and moving between gates. The system has also proved to be very efficient for handling passengers, but the distances between the terminal and the concourse necessitate the use of a sophisticated people-mover system  11 . 4 Table 1  A summary of our design themes and innovations with an assessment of present day Technology Readiness Levels and Pros and Cons. (1. reference  71 ) The remote pier design is also strategic as it can incorporate future updates to airport developments and aircraft changes. For example, hydrogen-powered aircraft may be slightly longer than traditional gate parking spaces  46  and BWB designs may be wider  a remote pier design will be readily adaptable to these changes. The remote piers can also be extended horizontally to add more gates for larger volumes of flights and passengers. In the future, we will likely have an updated version of a shuttle running between the concourses, either under or above ground. This system will have to be highly efficient to get passengers to the farthest concourse in a reasonable amount of time. Since the concourses can also be very long, there will need to be a people-moving system within the airport as well. 4.1.2 Gate Design When considering gate design, aircraft design will dictate the requirements. According to NASA s studies on blended wing-body aircraft, these planes can operate out of existing airport terminals  51 . These planes have a wingspan slightly larger than a Boeing 747, and cargo and passengers can utilize entrances at the front and rear of the aircraft. Because of the larger wingspan, it may be useful to have gates farther apart, or even designate two gates to a flight in order to facilitate more efficient boarding of the plane since there will be a much larger capacity for passengers available. There are already some flights that have multiple jet bridges to different entrances  this systemis typically used to board first class and business class from separate entrances. Thismodel can be used with blended wing-body aircraft as well. 4.1.3 Urban AirMobility Landing Port Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a burgeoning mode of transportation for moving passengers over short distances, similar to a taxi and airports are a likely destination to support UAM infrastructure. To support UAM traffic, we envision a large landing area near the airport where passengers can disembark and proceed to the terminal. In terms of airport integration, the Denver International Airport s remote pier layout and large airport footprint can accommodate such a design with ease. There is space for the landing port and passenger transport to be located on the airport in a safe and operable location without interfering with other airport activities. The landing area would also require significant electrification infrastructure to meet UAM aircraft recharge requirements before departing. Autonomy plays a large role in the landing port area for the UAMs because many of the operations, like passenger transport and 5 maintenance, do not have to be handled by human operators. Aside from passenger movement, UAMs can be used to handle small scale logistics transportation. Any shipments can be efficiently transported across the city without relying on road vehicles and traffic. 4.1.4 Centralized Energy Hub Each of the possible future energy sources has different storage requirements. Our proposed innovation is to expand current jet fuel storage areas into a centralized, multi-fuel energy hub. In this configuration, jet fuel containers will remain in place and be used to store Sustainable Aircraft Fuel mixtures  56, 49 . Hydrogen will require new storage infrastructure to meet pressurization, cooling and safety requirements  65  and likely additional space due to its lower volumetric density  6 . Similar to hydrogen, ammonia is likely to be stored in a liquid state with specific requirements driving new infrastructure  38, 20, 26, 16 . The final component to the energy hub will be a battery recharge and swap center which will assist in faster aircraft turn around time by replacing aircraft batteries at the gate versus recharging  76, 31 . The depleted batteries can then be recharged at the battery storage facility for a future aircraft. Furthermore, this energy hub can be tied into an airport power generation facility that can be fueled by on-site solar power or hydrogen fuel and can help supplement contributions from the grid. In summary, new fuel types will require new infrastructure with associated costs  while most technologies are not new, they have yet to be implemented in a combined airport facility. 4.1.5 Connected Autonomy We anticipate that the airport of the future will rely heavily on connected autonomous vehicles, which will conduct aircraft operations and routine tasks safely and efficiently. Several types of airport operations vehicles have autonomous prototypes in development including baggage trucks  12 , snow plows  48, 47, 64 , bird mitigation vehicles  68, 21  and even aircraftmaintenance and preflight inspections  1, 30, 45 . To enable safe coordination, each autonomous vehicle will broadcast its position and activities to nearby vehicles and larger planning systems. Knowledge of the surrounding environment will prevent vehicle incidents and may also allow for more efficient vehicle movements instead of requiring a defined set of vehicle paths. Autonomous systems may also enable rapid decision making which may prove to be essential for supporting increased aviation demand. Essential to a connected environment are fortified cybersecurity networks. The risks associated with adversary intrusion into autonomous airport vehicles could be catastrophic and, as a result, the airport network will require additional protection measures fromexploits, viruses, and other ransomware. Cybersecurity protectionmeasures may not always be a perfect solution and therefore a human presence will likely still be required in airport operations to respond in the event of an attack. This is essential for the safety of passengers and operators throughout the airport. 4.1.6 Standardized and Autonomous Logistics Containers A specific subset of the connected autonomy innovation is the incorporation of standardized containers for baggage, packages, batteries, food, fuel etc. We envision that these containers will be battery or hydrogen powered and autonomous, similar to the design from Aurrigo  12  or Plug Power  34 . Standardization of the containers will allow for an efficient sequencing of payloads, e.g. bring food to an aircraft arrival, transport baggage back to the terminal, then transport new baggage from the terminal to another flight etc. These containers could also have their own automated entrances and exits to the airport terminal that are close to the gates so that there isminimal above-ground disruption where the planes are taxiing. In the future, there may also be opportunities to airlift the logistics containers to decrease transit duration, for example bringing fuel or batteries from a distant storage location. The Defense Advanced 6 Research Projects Agency, LockheedMartin, and Piasecki Aircraft were developing Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial system to fill this function  however, the program was recently cancelled due to cost overruns and technical challenges  58, 74 . Nevertheless, this mode of transportationmay be worth exploring in the future as technologymatures. 4.2 Technology Development Timeline The pace of implementation for each of our innovations is varied and dependent on both aircraft and infrastructure developments. Figure 1 summarizes our technology development timeline. Figure 1  A technology development timeline for our airport design concepts. The pace of innovation is dependent on changes to aircraft and infrastructure. 5 Conclusions Tomeet the 2050 sustainability goals set by organizations like NASA, airports will have to adopt similar themes of sustainability and autonomy. Our themes encompass a set of innovations including a new terminal layout and gate designs, an Urban Air Mobility landing port, a centralized energy storage, and a network of connected autonomous vehicles. Each of these design concepts are at a sufficient technology readiness level that they could be developed and available by 2050. The innovations also provide necessary improvements for new aircraft and are flexible in implementation and expansion. Although our innovations were initially based on applications to Denver International Airport, many of our recommendations can be applied to other airports. As a result, our concepts can be broadly applied tomeet 2050 decarbonization goals",,,,,,
Project ECOAir (Ohio State U),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2022 - ""Airports of Tomorrow""",,"Introduction The timeliness and convenience of air transportation has led to billions of passengers utilizing air travel each year. Future advancements in aircraft technology will only increase industry appeal, causing a rise in air traffic and passenger rate. Although beneficial for airlines, this is a cause for environmental concern, as the aviation industry currently emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) between heavy flight traffic, nonrenewable fuel sources, and airport operations themselves. To prevent detrimental and irreversible environmental effects, changes must be implemented within the industry, including within airport operations. Major airline companies and aviation contributors are working on plans for greener flight within aircraft design and fuel consumption, working toward the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Alterations of these aircraft are projected to greatly decrease harmful emissions and promote flight efficiency. The success and viability of these developments is largely reliant on airports  ability to accommodate them with necessary infrastructure. To successfully fly with fuel-efficient engines, for example, commercial airlines first require access to adequate refueling facilities and timely turnaround processes that will ensure company profitability. If future aircraft changes do come to fruition, appropriate space and facilities must be ready to accommodate them. Project ECOAir proposes a design that suits the estimated changes in aircraft while altering current ground processes. The concept aims to promote airport convenience and efficiency, aircraft accommodation, and sustainability. Accounting for the vast predicted increase in passenger rate by 2050, the bridged gate-pod design will disperse passenger activity to mitigate gate congestion and boarding complications. Subsequent open ground space will allow aircraft to taxi between gates and runways with ease, reducing ground traffic. The current complex and costly baggage transportation process will be optimized and transitioned underground, minimizing complications for both airlines and passengers. Several fuel options will be made available, and waste from processes such as deicing will be conserved. Ground support equipment will be mostly autonomous to improve safety and decrease turnaround time. Regarding the airport facility itself, clean energy and sustainable building materials will be utilized to decrease direct emissions. By incorporating environmentally friendly technologies and reliable infrastructure, Project ECOAir s airport will sustain efficiency in air travel to promote a brighter future of aviation. Preliminary Research and Assessment 2050 Commercial Aviation Outlook To perform an analysis of the expected aviation outlook in 2050, the current state of the industry must be accounted for. This includes an assessment of commercial aviation consumers, vehicle structure, energy sources, and current environmental status. Air Transportation Rate. Passenger traffic rate experienced a steady growth for decades until 2020, when the Coronavirus pandemic led to a substantial decrease in commercial air transportation. In 2019, the global airline industry served 4.558 billion passengers  19 , declining to 1.8 billion during the pandemic  27 . Boeing predicts a near full recovery by 2024  31 , and by 2050, it is estimated that the global air industry will haul 16 billion passengers and 400 tons of cargo  56 . The projected increase in global population from 7.7 billion to 9.7 billion people  29  will lead to an inevitable increase in air transportation. This will require nearly double the number of today s operational aircraft, estimating 50,000 functional planes worldwide in 2050  54 . Aircraft Shapes and Designs. Today, most commercial planes consist of a long, slender fuselage, a vertical and horizontal stabilizer within the empennage, and capacities of 100-200 passengers  20 . Within this layout, aircraft such as the Boeing 737 family and Airbus 320 have been ruling the industry for decades. On average, it takes 15 years for major aircraft companies to begin mass production and roll out of new plane designs. Furthermore, the considerable financial component involved in major alterations disincentivizes innovation within already working components. Therefore, it is expected that the primary aircraft flown commercially in 2050 will consist of similar physical layouts to current models, with some size variations and material changes. 2 PROJECT ECOAIR As one of the primary contributors to commercial aviation, Boeing will likely implement aircraft improvements over the next 30 years. Recent development has been seen on the 787-Dreamliner, making it one of the top commercial aircraft in use in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Improvements have shown a 30  decrease in its CO2 emissions and a 60  decrease in its noise footprint compared to previous models  3 . The strong carbon fiber structure and 30  fuel reduction from hybrid laminar flow control  46  predict the 787 as a leading force in coming years. Developments have also been made on the Boeing ecoDemonstrator (Figure 1), which is predicted to serve a significant number of passengers by 2050. After testing in 2021, Boeing reported that the hybrid fueled aircraft is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 75  throughout its lifecycle, powered by sustainable fuel and incorporating recycled materials like carbon-composite fiber. This model is currently undergoing testing between NASA and Boeing to research the effects of sustainable fuel use in its engines  10 . Aside from Boeing, Airbus has announced promising expectations for 2050 with their ZEROe aircraft (Figure 2). The ZEROe series consists of three liquid hydrogen powered design concepts, including the Turbofan, Turboprop, and Blended-Wing Body  6 . These aircraft include a hybrid-electric propulsion system, using fuel cells to complement the gas turbine  7 . By 2035, this aircraft series will be able to carry ranges of 100-200 passengers over 1,000 to 2,000NM distances, progressing to commercial use in the next 30 years. Green technologies are also being developed for use in general aviation that will have strong capabilities by 2050. Small aerospace companies are creating sustainable flying methods involving all-electric models that produce little noise and zero carbon emissions. The Pipistrel Group has revolutionized pilot training with the Electro plane models (Figure 3), which require short takeoff and landing distances and significantly decrease training costs by 70   44 . Lilium is developing the first general aviation vertical take-off and landing jet  an all-electric plane with a 6-passenger capacity that will be launched into commercial operations by 2024  35 . Dozens of additional aerospace companies are developing electric solutions to decrease carbon emissions and provide private pilots with better flying experiences. Overall, research shows that the most prominent large passenger flights will occur with Boeing 767, 777, and 787s, while handfuls of 737 s and 747 s will still be in operation. The ecoDemonstrator and Dreamliner models will provide large contributions to efficient long-duration travel. Airbus s main contributions will continue to be the 320-350 models, with an emphasis on the functional operational development of the ZEROe series. It is probable that the industry will see several successful passenger flights with the ZEROe planes, as well as fully electric powered general aviation aircraft. Renewable Fuels and Energy Sources. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global aviation industry contributed 2.1  of the world s CO2 emissions, producing 915 million tons of CO2 in 2019  5 . Representatives of air transportation have recently declared the urgent goal to reduce this number to net zero emissions within the next 30 years. The largest current contributor to aviation emissions is aircraft fuel, and therefore drastic alterations to the fuel types used must occur. The most promising fuel outlook for 2050 is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made of resources such as feedstocks and waste oils  12 . By implementing SAF, the industry aims for an 80  CO2 emission reduction compared to conventional kerosene  50 . A major benefit of SAF is the simplicity of implementation, as combustion does not require installing a new propulsion system within current aircraft. It is currently being integrated into traditional aircraft fuel, with some airlines incorporating SAF at ratios of 10-15   33 . To reach a complete use of SAF in 2050, up to 445 million tons will be needed annually at that time  3 . The future of this fuel type looks promising according to Boeing, who recently committed to a supply agreement of 2 million gallons of SAF, with plans for 100  SAF implementation by 2030  40 . Due to manufacturing companies  Figure 1  Boeing ecoDemonstrator  11  Figure 2  Pipistrel electric aircraft fleet  45  Figure 3  Airbus ZEROe series  8  3 PROJECT ECOAIR increased interest in sustainable fuel, there is an expected decrease in price in the near future. Therefore, it is assumed for this report that the use of SAF will be widely available in 2050. Alternatively, Airbus is confident in plans for the ZEROe aircraft series, which will be primarily powered by liquid hydrogen. Although not currently developed to the point of SAF, testing of   2 is currently underway to fulfill the requirements for incorporation into industry by 2035. In the year 2050,   2 will be a sustainable method of propulsion for new Airbus models and will produce zero carbon emissions  6 . Within general aviation, fully electric propulsion systems will likely be integrated by 2050. Although they will not be optimized for large scale commercial aviation, it is projected that most functional private planes will be made with electric capabilities. This system will cut CO2 emissions and decrease the cost of private flying drastically. In sum, it is likely that SAF, liquid hydrogen, and minor electric power will make up most aircraft propulsion techniques used in 2050. As such, it is crucial that these options be readily available to various airlines within future airport designs. Landscape. Future rising sea levels predict that multiple U.S. airports will be submerged by the year 2150. When designing an airport for 2050, it is important to consider continual changes in landscape factors past this timeline to analyze the type of renovations and maintenance this design will require. There is an estimated 5m sea level rise by 2150  problematic for several airports including JFK, MIA, and SFO  14 . As these major U.S. airports become inoperable due to environmental factors, any new airport design should be placed in a location where sea level rises do not have a direct impact. ECOAir Design Rationale Location. The proposed location of this airport is Fairfax County, Virginia. The nearby existing airport, Dulles International Airport (IAD), is considered the primary airport for Virginia and Washington D.C., with 103 nonstop domestic and 52 international destinations  1 . In 2019, IAD served 24.06 million passengers, making it one of the busiest and largest airports in the U.S.  39 . Despite its heavy traffic rate, IAD has few plans to become sustainable and eco-friendly. According to U.S. News, IAD produced 3.97 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, with a carbon intensity of 95  37 . These emissions could decrease with the implementation of a new, nearby design. Fairfax County was chosen due to its proximity to major cities, projected population increase, elevation, and potential for carbon emission decrease. At an elevation of 312 feet  23 , this location provides optimal atmospheric conditions for takeoff and landing and is located outside of the range of problematic sea level increase. The county population is projected to grow by nearly 200,000, reaching 1,308,224 by 2040  57 , deeming it a suitable location for industry and employment opportunities. The average annual temperature is predicted to rise from 56.5 F currently to 60.7 F in 2050, providing optimal conditions for functional renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and solar panels  41 . This airport, in replacement of Dulles, will become a central destination for the Northeastern United States. The current Dulles airport will primarily function as a cargo and non-passenger transportation hub. Consequently, passenger emissions will be largely reduced, while still utilizing the space occupied by Dulles  current facility. Physical Airport Structure. The new airport will centralize all passenger activities within the main building. There will be an underground facility that hosts all preflight activities prior to leading passengers up escalators to the main floor, where they will begin the boarding procedure. Passengers will be directed through one of the four bridges that span across the taxiways, each leading to several gate pods. These pods separate what would be considered a main terminal into smaller sections to decrease passenger congestion and provide convenient gate access. Extending above each terminal is a rounded bridge that allows easy transport between gates for passengers with connecting flights. This simplification allows these Figure 4  ECOAir airport concept 4 PROJECT ECOAIR passengers to bypass the main building and incoming bridge traffic during layovers. Planes can easily arrive and depart from gates more independently from surrounding aircraft and will have plenty of space to move between pods to reach the runways. The back wing-like walls provide storage for ground operation equipment on one side and small electric charging stations on the other. See Figure 4 for the final design. Infrastructure. The airport building infrastructure is sustainable, made from materials such as mass timber and reused steel. Mass timber is fire-resistant and strong, weighing 1 5 that of a concrete alternative and demonstrating a high strength-to-weight ratio  53 . Construction is cost efficient, as mass timber buildings are roughly 25  faster to construct than concrete buildings and require 90  less construction traffic. Replacing steel with mass timber reduces building carbon emissions by roughly 20 . The use of mass timber can also sequester CO2, ultimately inverting emissions  53 . Additionally, the airport incorporates electrochromic glass windows as a means of energy conservation. As the U.S. Department of Energy reports, conventional windows experience energy loss accounting for 30  of heating and cooling energy. Using electrochromic  smart  glass that adapts to external conditions will minimize energy use by reducing heat energy in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, as well as electrical lighting year-round  48 . Electrochromic windows have been evaluated to provide significant heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting savings, specifically in commercial buildings. They are especially efficient when windows are unobstructed by neighboring buildings, making it a beneficial component of this airport that is surrounded by flat land. Finally, the exterior roofing and general exterior of the airport will be colored white. A light exterior will reduce greenhouse effects by a small margin and will keep the airport cooler in the summers, reducing energy consumption via the HVAC system  43 . Apron and Taxiways. The ground space will be comprised of graphene-enhanced materials using the recently developed Gipave technology  a polymeric asphalt super modifier made of nanotechnology and recycled plastic  30 . Not only is this material proven to resist long term deformation on busy runways, but it will produce 70  less CO2 emissions compared to standard asphalt  58 . Results from testing the low-maintenance, environmentally friendly material project it to be a cost effective, sensible option for a 2050 airport. Ground Operations. The majority of ground support equipment, including crew transport and taxiing devices, will be fully electric and mostly autonomous. These devices will be stored in the back wings of the facility with access to several charging stations powered by solar panels. To conserve fuel, Taxibots will assist pilots in gate pushback and guide the plane across the apron (Figure 5)  51 . A Taxibot is a semi-autonomous device controllable by the pilot, capable of towing large class aircraft. CO2 emissions and noise levels will be significantly reduced because of its use, as aircraft engines will not have to be powered on upon initial departure. No aircraft modifications will be required for this device to be used, and 85  of the normal taxiing fuel consumption will be cut compared to current gate pushback processes  28 . Fuel can be conserved so that the pilot must only power on the engines directly before takeoff, at which point the Taxibot will continue directing the plane to the runway, streamlining traffic on the apron. The Taxibot and other autonomous devices will increase the safety of ground operations. Incorporating artificial intelligence will decrease ground accidents caused by human error, while still allowing options for pilots to take full control of the plane s path if necessary. Deicing. Today, aircraft deicing procedures result in the excess drainage of harmful chemicals into local water supplies. Solutions to this issue have been attempted by collecting the runoff water, yet this does not completely negate the thousands of gallons of wasteful fluid currently used in a single process. To combat the issue of wasted deicing fluid, two alternative methods will be implemented at this airport. First, an open hangar will be built with infrared lighting to mostly replace use of fluid. This hangar will reduce glycol use by as much as 90  and will complete the deicing process in 75  less time than current methods. As a second option to infrared, controlled atmosphere separation technology (CAST) will be available, should standard glycol mixtures be needed in severe weather conditions. CAST will distill the mixture of deicing fluid and water Figure 5  Taxibot in use  51  5 PROJECT ECOAIR collected on the ground to separate the fluid from runoff water. With CAST, up to 57  of all the deicing fluid used on aircraft can be treated for further re-use or resale  16 . By recovering the deicing fluid using this process, airports currently can save nearly  3.50 per gallon recycled. This economic benefit will allow CAST to maintain a profit over time and will be a greener alternative to allowing deicing fluid to drain into the Fairfax County water supplies. Overall, pairing infrared technology with as-needed fluid separation procedures will drastically decrease wasted material, and infrared heating will especially improve turnaround time between flights. Baggage. Baggage systems in current airports include a variety of conveyor belts and scanners, tracking luggage from main baggage check to the aircraft. It requires substantial labor to move bags off the belts, onto trucks, and into the plane. A large portion of traffic on the ground space is a result of time-consuming luggage loading. To mitigate mistakes and time delays, this system will be optimized and redesigned. Bags will be transported via conveyor belts from baggage check to an underground sorting location, centralized underneath the main structure of the airport. Here, bags will be autonomously sorted into grouped luggage pod units using pre-existing scanning technology and machine learning. These pods will move on radial conveyor belts directly up to the gate to which they will be captured and loaded into the aircraft. Fuel. Fuel sources will be available for refueling at gates through an underground piping system. SAF and liquid hydrogen fuel lines will be separated, each leading to different gates. Refueling will continue to take place simultaneously with passenger turnover. Automated fuel trucks will be available as a secondhand fueling option, should there be maintenance occurring on the underground piping system. A liquid hydrogen hub, primarily used by ZEROe planes, will be placed on the airport grounds, using electrolysis to provide fuel to the fuel lines. Sustainable Energy. Project ECOAir has incorporated several forms of sustainable energy sources projected to be easily accessible 30 years from now  the main features being solar panels and wind turbines. Considering the expected upcoming surge in use of solar energy, solar panels are a lucrative option to power airport components. This is due to their low cost and the anticipated high demand for rechargeable hybrid aircraft. Panels will be located on the roof of the main building as well as edges of the airspace. Strategically placed mirrors will redirect deflected light to surrounding panels, increasing each panel s efficiency, while adhering to FAA regulations regarding glare  32 . Sun tracking technology will also be used to align the panels so that maximum efficiency can be achieved throughout each day. Most of the solar power output will contribute to the electric charging stations in place for both aircraft and ground support equipment. Quiet Revolution vertical axis wind turbines (Figure 7) will be placed in pairs along the edges of the airport green space, each pair spanning 9.3m to prevent wind interference. Variations of 6m tall masts support the turbines, using a hydraulic system to position the turbine horizontally for maintenance. Energy conversion results from a 3.13m diameter of rotation, requiring significantly less space than traditional wind turbines  45 . These turbines will be used for their sustainable, carbon-fiber composition and impact on noise reduction. They will operate under 20m s wind speeds, making them a useful option for Fairfax, County, as the highest expected wind speed ranges from 4-10m s  13 . These devices are predicted to remain operational for the airport past the year 2080, prior to needing replacement. Geothermal technology will be utilized in the form of an underground piping system, taking advantage of the natural difference between subsurface soil temperatures and above-ground air. The main building will be heated through a series of buried pipes circulating fluid. A heat exchanger will then transfer heat into the building s existing air handling, distribution, and ventilation systems. Fluid will be recirculated back into the ground and heated again. For cooling, the geothermal heat pump will use the ground as its heat sink, releasing heat through the pipeline loop configuration  21 . This geothermal method is especially Figure 6  Visual of underground baggage conveyor belt Figure 7  QR6 turbines  45  6 PROJECT ECOAIR efficient because it is not dependent on consistent temperatures and weather conditions. This technology will reduce the airport greenhouse gas emissions by 40  compared to standard heating processes. It will also reduce water consumption, eliminating the costliest components of the airport s HVAC system  53 . Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) Integral components of this proposal involve technology that has mainly been successfully tested, while minor additions require further improvement to be put into use. Assessing TRLs can provide an estimate of the improvements necessary to integrate this airport design in the coming years. See Table 1 and 2 below for a breakdown of these assessments  55 . Table 1.

These advancements are necessary for the complete success of this 2050 s design concept. Conclusion ECOAir s design concept features will greatly increase airport efficiency and contribute to the industry-wide goal of reaching net-zero emissions. Passenger convenience is achieved through streamlined paths to terminals, while ground operation efficiency is optimized through use of automated devices and underground baggage transportation. This airport concept can accommodate the predicted variability in aircraft, offering a variety of fuel options and adequate ground space. Finally, sustainability will be achieved through use of eco-friendly runway materials, renewable energy, and waste conservation. Future developments within this proposal will focus mainly on the baggage system and deicing process. Regarding baggage, current AI developments suggest that passengers could be offered additional options regarding their luggage claim, such as allowing the airport to deliver luggage within a defined radius. Additionally, innovative uses for the conserved deicing fluid should be explored, such as storing the leftover glycol from CAST for deicing wind turbines in cold weather. Further developing these unique elements will elevate the success and capability of the facility. In the next 30 years, air travel will undergo exciting developments to curate a more sustainable industry. While monitoring innovation of commercial aircraft, engineers must think creatively to construct facilities that will adapt to the anticipated changes, ensuring adequate aircraft resources and positive passenger experience. The TRL levels listed indicate that this airport concept is implementable, as much of the technology is available. Therefore, airports do currently have the potential to transition to greener flight. However, the cost and construction implications of tearing down and remodeling an existing airport present an array of limitations. It is for this reason that this project proposes an entirely new design with alternative plans for existing locations. Aviation in its past, present, and future states is centered around innovation. From the first successful flights of early aircraft models to now, where thousands of commercial aircraft operate each day, the industry has made significant advancements that have gained substantial societal interest. Looking toward the future, engineering initiatives such as Project ECOAir are pushing the boundaries of conventional air transportation, promoting monumental strides toward greener flights and bluer skies.",,,,,,
Carbon Negative  A Modular Approach to Advancing Green Airport Infrastructure (U Penn),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2022 - ""Airports of Tomorrow""",,"1. Overview  The aviation industry has undergone several developments from its inception in 1903 to its transformation in security measures in the post-9 11 world. In the next 30 years, especially as regular travel operations resume post-pandemic, our research team anticipates a significant increase in the scope of the aviation sector and a sizable increase in the number of passengers relying on commercial aviation. As consumer and industry demands change, so will airport and airline offerings, which will revolutionize the way we view the critical environmental consequences of this industry. Following the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the aviation industry has recently made major advances towards becoming more sustainable and efficient. From a commercial manufacturer point of view, this is evidenced by the rise of ultra-efficient long haul aircraft such as the 787 and A350, which offer 25-30  less fuel burn and CO2 emission per seat over earlier widebody airplanes1. These commercial and technological advancements have been accompanied by infrastructural efforts to make airports more environmentally and economically friendly, such as solar panel installations and green roofs. These advances have not only improved sustainability for airports and airline carriers, but they have also helped expand routes and connect developing countries, which have limited funding for airports, to global air transport networks. As a result, technological advancements that lead to increased airline sustainability are also heavily economically incentivized both for governments and commercial airline carriers. Many experts and previous research have come to an agreement that airports  carbon footprints have the biggest impact on sustainability within the aviation sector.2 Aviation accounts for an estimated 2.5  of global carbon emissions3. More specifically, the ten largest airports worldwide generate an estimated 127 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually4. In fact, According to E Terrenoire et. al, carbon dioxide alone is expected to contribute to 36-51  of climate change caused by aviation in the short-term, and to have an even greater effect in the long term due to the gasses' long residence time in the atmosphere.5 As of today, airports and international organizations have set goals to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, including 242 airports in the United States6. However, as of 2021, only four airports have met this objective, including Austin-Bergstrom International airport7. We believe that in the next 30 years, it will become necessary for all 242 airports to collectively produce and implement novel technologies in order to become carbon neutral. In this report, we will assess various carbon mitigating technologies, including the rise of electric aircraft, the rise of electric support vehicles, and the use of advanced airport infrastructure, which will all collectively help airports work towards carbon neutrality objectives by 2050.

Technological Solutions Many aircraft manufacturers have investigated the use of alternative and more sustainable fuel sources, the most notable alternative fuel being electricity  this innovation has the potential to significantly decrease carbon emissions. We believe that the widespread use of electric and hybrid electric airplanes in the commercial aviation sector will significantly reduce net carbon emissions from airports. Likewise, the rise of commercial electric vehicles in recent years demonstrates the possible reliance on electric support vehicles that are used on the ground at airports. We believe that these will also constitute a large reduction in carbon emissions, especially as their use is compounded in airports across the world. In addition, we anticipate that airports will employ the use of advanced infrastructure systems in order to mitigate unavoidable carbon emissions. For example, the use of direct air capture systems that can increase the air quality on both airports and surrounding grounds. In this paper, we will discuss these systems, and how they can be used to decrease net carbon emissions. a. Electric Aircraft and Vehicles Recent advances in aircraft technology have led to the electrification of aircraft components that are traditionally hydraulic or pneumatic. For example, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 have pioneered the use of electrical systems for critical flight functions such as actuation, wing ice protection, and fuel pumping systems, which have led to reductions in noise pollution and fuel consumption.8 A 2015 study proposes a  More Electric Aircraft , which will make all existing systems (except for the engines) electrically powered. This includes cabin pressurization, which is currently pneumatically powered, fuel pumping, which is mechanically powered, and hydraulic components such as the flaps and landing gear. However, by 2050, we predict a widespread use of electric-propulsion and hybrid-electric aircraft. Electric aircraft have already been in development for many years. One example is the 600 kg Li-ion powered aircraft capable of flying 160 kph that was proposed in 2013.9 Since then, however, there have been significant advances. In 2021, Rolls-Royce successfully created and tested the  Spirit of Innovation , the fastest all-electric aircraft, which is capable of flying up to 555.9 kph.10 Although many electric aircraft today have been developed for smaller-scale operations, aircraft manufacturers have proposed electric and hybrid-electric aircraft models to enter commercial service by 2050. An early model, the Wright Spirit (proposed to enter service in 2026), will have seating capacity of approximately 100 passengers, and will have enough range to fly 1-hour long flights (for example, the London to France route).11 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also anticipates that hybrid electric aircraft, capable of seating up to 130 passengers, will enter commercial service after 2030.12 For example, the Boeing Sugar VOLT, proposed to enter service in 2040, will be able to seat 135 passengers and have a range of over 6000 km.13 13  Large Commercial Aircraft  A Non Extensive List of Projects.

Compared to airplanes powered by conventional fuel sources with similar seating capacity and range, electric aircraft could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions and hybrid electric aircraft will lead to an additional possible reduction. According to researchers at MIT, these improvements can lead to a 92  reduction in air pollution-related deaths caused by the aviation sector.14These electric aircraft may also replace or partially replace current airplane models that lead to the highest percentage of carbon emissions worldwide. According to data compiled by the International Council on Clean Transportation, Regional and Narrowbody airplanes, which seat between 75 and 200 passengers, were responsible for almost 60  of carbon emissions in the aviation sector.15 Airports can support the adoption of electric aircraft into commercial service by building and conducting research on electric charging stations to support electric aircraft. Electric charging infrastructure has seen preliminary usage in airports and testing as of today. For example, in October 2021, Swedish airport operator Swedavia opened 3 aircraft charging stations at a regional airport16. Trainelli et. al predicts that there will be two main types of charging stations  plug in stations and battery swapping stations. However, both types of stations experience unique barriers to smooth operations and quick turnaround time. Plug-in stations are currently infeasible for commercial airports due to their excessive charging times. Although battery swapping stations have the advantage of being able to charge batteries while they are not in use, numerous battery charging stations will be required to efficiently charge and prepare batteries for future flights.17 Several attempts have been made to tackle these challenges. For example, Guo et al. propose a model that can significantly increase the efficiency and economic feasibility of battery charging by compiling data on demand for electricity throughout the day.18 However, additional research and investigations must be conducted before charging stations that are economically feasible for commercial airports can be built. Airports can help to achieve widespread installation of these charging stations by 2050 by installing and testing current charging station technologies, and conducting research studies on how to improve station price effectiveness and charging efficiency. Airports also should prioritize a greater switch to electric ground transport and support vehicles. On its own, transportation is the fourth largest source of global carbon emissions at 14  of the total, and the technology already exists for airport transport vehicles to make a greater push towards going electric.19 Currently, nearly all of the cargo tractors and belt loaders currently in use are gasoline or diesel powered and most often specifically chosen for the purposes of reliability and low maintenance. General Motors has announced an initiative to further develop conversion technology, which would allow for the retrofitted installation of an electric drivetrain into conventionally combustion engine-powered vehicles. Their announcement of a partnership with Textron Ground Support Equipment Inc. for the specific development of electric airport ground transportation bolsters the fact that electric-powered ground 19  Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data , United States Environmental Protection Agency, https   www.epa.gov ghgemissions global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data. 18 Z.

Airports must also be responsible for the installation of safety equipment and infrastructure for electric airplanes. As of February 2020, the FAA restricts the transport of Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) Batteries on any commercial flight. Electric aircraft, which may rely on Li-Ion batteries as their primary power source, will therefore require additional safety precautions before they can enter into commercial service21. Gao et. al has shown in their study on flame retardant Li-ion battery storage systems that thermal runaway retardant (TRR) capsules can help protect Li-ion batteries from fire damage while still maintaining their electrochemical performance.22 Such capsules have seen significant improvements over the past few years and have helped to greatly improve the safety of electric vehicles. Capsules can serve as protective equipment both for airport storage facilities and on-board the aircraft. Airports must also invest in airport crew training and equipment to effectively fight lithium fires on the ground. Since lithium fires are difficult to fight compared to conventional fires, airport firefighters must be trained to effectively respond to on-board lithium fires.23 b. Airport Implementation of Exterior Direct Air Carbon Capture Systems By 2050, electric and hybrid vehicles will have not entirely phased out the existing fleet of conventional vehicles.24 To best support green aviation technology of the future, airports must continue to offset the emissions of conventional airplanes. Direct air capture (DAC) is the name for technologies that extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere through a series of chemical processes and filters. DAC can function as both a carbon negative solution, when the captured CO2 is stored in underground geological formations, or carbon neutral solution when the CO2 is used for industrial, mechanical, or synthetic fuel purposes. In order for DAC to function as a carbon negative solution, it must minimize its CO2 output in the form of energy consumption so that the net offset is negative. Optimizing that offset has proven to be one of the main challenges for engineers. To sequester enough carbon from the air, most DAC systems today use fans to draw in as much air as possible in order to maximize the CO2 concentration. As a result the fans draw energy from the grid and the system risks emitting more CO2 than it is sequestering. We propose that airports take advantage of their unique role as a large carbon emitting hub and implement DAC systems around the airport. DAC falls under the category of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS systems have existed for many years, but it has mainly been implemented in power plants where CO2 emissions are heavily concentrated, and the captured CO2 can be mechanically used, like recovering oil from the ground or pneumatically powering machines. DAC is a relatively new concept in climate technology. The first DAC plant began operating in 2015 through the company Carbon Engineering, and another large scale plant built by the company Climeworks began operating in 2017 and removes 4000 tons of CO2 per year.

By 2050, DAC systems will be at level 9 with widespread use and scale. By 2050, however, the cost per ton of sequestering carbon dioxide is expected to decrease dramatically. A study that reviewed relevant literature and current commercial trends projected that the cost of DAC could be reduced to  85 per ton of CO2. Combined with a renewable energy infrastructure, designing a large DAC system will be feasible by 2050.26 Looking at the United States as a possible need and use case study, airports are uniquely positioned to take advantage of DAC. According to an air travel study done by Upgraded Points, a consumer travel blog, 29.5 percent of U.S. cities with populations greater than 50,000 people are located within 25 miles of a large hub (defined as receiving 1  or more of annual enplanements within the United States.27, 28 Furthermore, a CDC study, Rural and Urban Differences in Air Quality, 2008 2012, and Community Drinking Water Quality, 2010 2015   United States, found that rural  counties experienced fewer unhealthy air-quality days than large central metropolitan counties, likely because of fewer air pollution sources in the non core counties. 29 Urban cities are on average closer to large hubs and have higher concentrations of air pollution. Large, concentrated, local populations could directly benefit from DAC being adopted by large hubs within the United States specifically. The large hubs are also suited for the physical and electrical demands of DAC systems. Airports generally encompass large and flat lands with limited vertical obstructions and have large rooftop surfaces on airport infrastructure including terminals, parking garages, hangers, and transportation facilities. Airports are also heavily investing in their renewable energy capability, Denver International Airport is one such example, since 2008 the airport has added 56 acres of solar panel coverage, offsetting up to 11,465 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions yearly.30 With more airports implementing renewable energy sources, DAC systems could possibly take advantage of carbon neutral energy to become carbon negative systems and have impacts beyond the airport. The energy demands of a DAC system are dependent on factors such as the molar concentration of CO2 in the ambient air and how much the system is running. The amount of energy required for each ton of carbon sequestration decreases exponentially with an increase in molar concentration.31 Referring to Appendix 3, ambient air sits on the top of the curve and as a result requires an immense amount of energy. DAC systems will not be able to substantially get around this challenge, however, DAC systems can utilize specific ambient conditions to their advantage. Outlined above, emissions from planes, cars, and the overall size of the airport contributes to high CO2 concentrations around an airport. 31 Wilcox J. (2012) Introduction to Carbon Capture.

Appendix 4 shows emissions as a mole fraction over the course of a day. The fraction peaks at .08 and averages around .05 as the day progresses. Comparing that to the figure provided by Wilcox, the CO2 concentration is similar to that of a natural gas combustion point source which requires an exponentially less amount of energy to remove. By positioning carbon capture systems at airports, the systems could be three times more efficient, making them an excellent option for supporting the transition to an electric fleet of aircraft. Airports will employ modular carbon capture systems similar to those of Climeworks, a leader in the commercial DAC industry with the largest DAC system in operation. Climeworks's DAC system employs a technology called low temperature solid sorbent direct air capture.33 Ambient air flows into the system and the CO2 chemically binds to a sorbent filter. Once the sorbent is saturated with CO2, air intake is cut off and a process called regeneration begins. During regeneration, the system is heated to 100C where the CO2 is purified. The compressed gas is then transferred through a network of pipelines where it is stored underground. In terms of implementation, placement, and location of carbon capture systems on airport grounds, the research team looked to the Federal Aviation Administration's Technical Guidance for Evaluating Selected Solar Technologies on Airports, we propose both roof and ground mounted DAC systems. When exploring the viability of DAC systems, space is an important factor. Most airports have large unused spaces including noise buffers, areas near runways, and rooftops. Rural airports tend to have more possible citing locations, whereas urban airports may be limited to terminals, parking garages, and hangers. With either ground or rooftop mounted systems, existing aviation and airport activities must be evaluated. When designing and implementing DAC systems on airport ground it is important not to obstruct or impede on air navigation pursuant to 14 CFR Part 77 SAFE, EFFICIENT USE, AND PRESERVATION OF THE NAVIGABLE AIRSPACE, which is a governing doctrine for construction on airport grounds.34 Airport buildings (terminals) most often have flat rooms whereas hangers have angled roofs, both options provide many placement options for direct. Using FAA guidance outlined for mounting solar panels on airport roofs, a pre-mounting analysis of existing roof capacity is required to determine if the structure is efficient to hold the extra weight of a DAC, weights are dependent on the number of units, their size, and other equipment such as piping and mechanicals that are mounted directly on the units or are an another location.35 Installation of ground-mounted DAC systems, an example seen in Appendix 2, requires mostly flat terrain with reasonably unobstructed access and exposures. Given the weight of DAC systems and related components, such as CO2 storage tanks, power inverters, and other associated structures to house mechanicals, geotechnical analysis may be required to determine the long term soil stability.

DAC systems should meet applicable building code standards and all DAC systems should be equipped with lightning protection measures. Possible benefits to airports include achieving carbon neutral and or negative status, the ability to sell carbon allotments to airlines, companies, and other customers, as well as industrial or CO2 storage. Currently, DAC systems can cost in the hundreds of millions and the team recommends public   private partnerships. As DAC systems grow in popularity they will be coming to more and more areas, airports are in a key position to be able to incorporate them into their infrastructure and design(s). 3. Conclusion and Discussion After extensively reviewing existing research regarding ways airports contribute to carbon emissions, types of carbon emissions, aviation infrastructure types, and technology readiness scores, our team chose three technology categories that will have promising impacts on the airports of tomorrow. As battery technology improves and electric vehicles begin to match the efficiency and cost of conventional fossil fuels, electric vehicles will begin to swap out their counterparts, both on the ground and in the sky. This will require major infrastructural updates so airports can facilitate charging, battery maintenance, battery storage, and battery combustion. Furthermore, instead of investing in passive infrastructure that reduces emissions and increases sustainability by choosing the greener option over another, airports can incorporate direct air capture systems to become active carbon negative organizations. Explored through a high level case study of large hub airports within the United States, carbon capture systems will have both positive economic and environmental ramifications for airports and their surrounding areas. The design for the airports of tomorrow begins with an understanding and assessment of the technologies of today. The research team hopes that our novel, yet implementable solutions will help airports lead the way for a greener and cleaner future.",,,,,,
Bluebonnet Skies (UT Austin),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2022 - ""Airports of Tomorrow""",,"INTRODUCTION Carbon-neutrality in the aviation industry seems like a sky-high goal, but our Austin-based team is convinced it can be achieved by 2050, even with down-to-Earth assumptions. We analyzed fuel policies in many of the world s largest economies and future aviation technologies to design an airport for tomorrow s sustainable world. Our airport is located in nearby Houston, which has a large, dynamic aviation market serving international, domestic, and regional routes. Houston also has the added constraint of frequent flooding and hurricanes. Before diving into our airport design and the research behind our decisions, we would like to justify a couple of key choices for tomorrow s airport. For the primary fuels for these projected aircraft of 2050, we selected Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and electrical batteries for their practical application. As SAF is currently in use, both governments and airlines have already designed policies and infrastructure around them. Moreover, SAF and battery-electric planes receive the most industry attention and investments. SAFs can be 100  carbon-neutral 1, 2, depending on how they are produced, and reduce contrails by 70 3, significantly reducing the amount of heat trapped underneath an airplane s path. Battery-electric planes can be 100  carbon-neutral if they are charged from a sustainable source. Although hydrogen and ammonia have recently received a lot of media interest, we have determined these technologies will not be used in the aviation industry by 2050. These unattainable fuels have too many design concerns and unrealistic expectations due to the need for significant infrastructure overhauls that most airports could not support, sizable design challenges for current and future technologies, and lack of attention in the startup or established aviation world. For instance, Airbus recently stated they do not believe hydrogen-powered planes will be possible by 2050.4 Aircraft of the future will look similar to today with the addition of narrow supersonic aircraft, blended-wing body aircraft, and efficient small electric jets designed to carry heavy batteries. These new aircraft will impose challenges on today s infrastructure and were an important part of our investigation. Many airport terminals already have sunk costs within their construction and private developers prefer to utilize and adapt their existing facilities rather than completely discard them for a futuristic and financially unattainable airport. Accordingly, our futuristic airport design is financially viable and is based upon reducing energy consumption, generating extra on-site energy for electric planes and vehicles, and emphasizing flexibility to allow our airport to adapt to future changes in aviation. OUR AIRPORT DESIGN Our design rests on three pillars - flexibility, transition, and reliability. Flexibility allows our design to adapt to future technologies  transition makes our project trailblazing yet attainable airport that even dated airports can adopt  reliability means our airport has additional system redundancies, where if one system fails another system will automatically kick into action, without skipping a beat. In terms of power redundancy, the airport will be connected to the local municipal grid with the addition of onsite renewable energy generation to ensure renewables are the focus of energy consumption while assuring that the airport is not shut down due to unforeseen events that inhibit renewable energy generation. Mega batteries, added over time, will store energy generated on-site. However, because most of the airport s open spaces support taxiways and runways, which are encompassed by obstacle-free zones, only limited space beside the terminal structures and landside areas is set aside for sustainable energy generation. As a result, our design showcases a transparent solar-panel roof above the electric aircraft gate areas (Figure 4) and the installation of various vertical-axis wind turbines throughout the airport to exploit these underutilized vertical spaces as seen in Houston Intercontinental terminal B (Figure 3). The solar roof features semi permeable plastic next-generation solar panels modules, serving as a skylight by allowing light to pass through while collecting energy with solar cells. Our design draws inspiration from the Worldport terminal (Figure 2) from 1958, which allowed aircraft to park underneath an overhanging umbrella that offered a convenient way of boarding before jet bridges were invented. The airport will also receive several smaller wind turbines to capture energy from natural and airplane-produced winds. Houston s humid subtropical climate produces nearly 50 inches of rain annually. These high levels of precipitation mean the new wind turbines will be 3   P a g e relied upon as the primary source for energy generation. Examples of potential future wind power technologies are Joe Doucet s wind turbine wall, EWICON bladeless turbines, Vortex Bladeless, Icewind s Freya, and the Halcium PowerPod, all of which are small enough to be out of the way of aircraft and visibility, have no moving parts or are covered, and can generate energy in unused areas of an airport, like beside hangars and on terminals facades. The batteries will charge electric aircraft and electric Ground Support Equipment (GSE) when they cannot be charged directly from energy generated on-site, due to low solar exposure or limited wind. Because electric GSEs can lose charge in cold weather, charging ports will be located underground at the gates to keep the gate area free and will be waterproofed to ensure they can withstand Houston flooding. The GSE will be automated, reducing their emissions by 5 5. Additionally, the batteries will allow electric aircraft to charge during a blackout. Energy generated on-site will allow airplanes to directly connect to electricity instead of using Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) or Ground Power Units (GPUs). Electric planes are initially expected to take longer to charge than their turnaround time, so our design features a parking lot hard stand gates for charging electric aircraft and GSE with a similar rooftop. Airliners will schedule aircraft rotations so a different fully-charged aircraft is ready to depart with passengers when the plane that just landed would originally be needed. Passengers will disembark the aircraft at these covered gates and connect to the main terminal via a covered walkway. Electric  taxibot  pushback tugs like those at Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport will bring airplanes between the runway, the hard stands, the terminal, and back to the runway, reducing plane fuel and electricity consumption when taxiing between the runway and gate. The roof has the added benefit of significantly shading the aircraft beneath it, reducing the energy needed to cool jet bridges and the aircraft plugged into the terminals. This plan will reduce the energy consumption of a gate's largest four energy consumers - cooling jet bridges, cooling the terminal, APUs GPUs, and GSE - while generating electricity and increasing passenger comfort. Light will pass through the translucent solar pael roof, eliminating the need for lighting during the day and dealing with the heavy rains of Houston. This configuration is minimal, meaning it is easily dismantlable for the introduction of larger electric aircraft that would require a taller roof, following the flexibility theme for the airport. Beneath the roof will be a similar gate layout to what we know today. Most planes will use SAF, which works smoothly with the same infrastructure as current jet A fuel, needing no additional infrastructure changes. Gates will have modular furniture and equipment to adapt to more aircraft types. Our main gate change is to use a pair of jet bridges to service blended-wing aircraft like the Flying V or X-48, streamlining boarding and disembarking. These aircraft will receive freight, baggage, food, and fuel from the back of the airplane to make space for the new jet bridge, significantly reducing turnaround time. When a blended-wing airplane is not at the gate, it can serve two small aircraft instead. Hence, one jet bridge at these gates will be redesigned to be more flexible to service planes that arrive at its left and right. Our design emphasizes flexibility by allowing the gate area to service small electric aircraft and also larger anticipated electric aircraft of the future. Regarding terminal operations, our terminals will mimic flagship airports in the world of sustainability, incorporating the highest LEED certifications and best energyefficient HVAC systems, lighting, and insulation. Finally, our airport will support electric vertical take-off (eVTOL) and landing aircraft. United Airlines, American Airlines, and Virgin Atlantic have announced orders for eVTOLs, which will be implemented in major hub airports to transport passengers from city cores to the airport. Additionally, our design features landing sites for eVTOLs, which are expected to require no more than three acres. Based on airport runway traffic patterns, such sites would be either on the airside area connected via people mover or on the landside area prominently on top of parking garages. AIRPORT DESIGN JUSTIFICATIONS Our airport design pays careful attention towards energy sources, aircraft design, and impacts upon passenger boarding. Fortunately, most aircraft flying to our 2050 airport will follow the same standardization of gate size configuration that has been followed since the 1950s, with the simple tube and wing aircraft design withstanding the test of time. Airplane families such as the Boeing 737, 787, 777, Airbus A350, and A320 will still be prominent in the 4   P a g e aviation market by 2050 because electrification of high-capacity airplanes is not viable by such timelines. However, smaller regional electric and hybrid aircraft of two to twenty passengers will require charging systems and charging rotations at a  parking lot  to maximize efficiency. Narrowbody and widebody aircraft in 2050 will use the current gate infrastructure with only minor adjustments. Future airline fleets will welcome the Boom Supersonic Overture, with the same wingspan as the ERJ-145  the KLM Tudelft Flying V, a hybrid wing-body aircraft, with the same wingspan as the Airbus A350  and the NASA X-48, with the same wingspan as the 767. Our flexible and modular gates will allow all of these aircraft to be served, supporting faster turnarounds as aforementioned for the electric aircraft and the hybrid wing-body aircraft. Advancements in small aircraft have allowed for the electrification of redesigned small prop aircraft, such as Eviation s Alice or Heart Aerospace s ES-19, and have also allowed for old aircraft to be retrofitted, such as the Cessna Caravans and Twin Otters. However, retrofitting requires airports to adjust to these aircraft using airside assets. Historically, airport terminal design has been inflexible to changing aircraft capacity and has failed to be future-proof. According to Bloomberg City Lab,  terminals developed in lockstep with the aircraft they served, which have increased from a passenger capacity of about 100 in 1960 to more than eight times that amount in 2007 s . Similarly, from 2030 to 2050, only small nine to nineteen passenger aircraft will be fully electric, and the size of such aircraft allows for more gate spaces to be added to the apron. For instance, the same distance of terminal length can fit three 737 MAX10s or six small electric aircraft. Our design emphasizes flexibility for the future by allowing our gate area to service small electric aircraft and future expected large electric aircraft. We designed our airport's infrastructure around aircraft turnaround times and the expected ground capacity of aircraft. Electric aircraft require three hours of charging to fly their maximum range, nearly 4.5 times longer than a typical turnaround time. Although small planes like the Alice could fly an hour on 30 minutes of charging, which is on par with today s turnaround schedule, some flight operations would require more charging, resulting in more planes parked than flying. Consequently, our airport will allow airlines to schedule aircraft rotations in the  parking lot.  AIRLINE MARKETS Airlines are switching to increased SAF usage, as seen in Table 1.1 and 1.2, due to international government mandates because it is more sustainable than Jet A fuel and can be implemented immediately. However, SAF is considerably more expensive than traditional fuel at nearly eight times6 the price of Jet A fuel. This means that the price of flying will increase for consumers and indirect competition, like trains, buses, and driving, will see increased demand from competitive pricing. Because electric aircraft are independent of jet fuels, they are projected to be less expensive to run due to a cheaper fuel source, longer motor life spans, and reduced maintenance costs. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) subsidizes airlines to fly regional flights between medium-sized cities and small towns in the Essential Air Service program to guarantee a minimum number of flights to citizens in remote areas across the country. These reports provide valuable insights into airline revenues and expenses for regional routes because airlines rarely make income statements public, where electric planes can be the preferred option. In 2005, Cape Air flight 9K 1853, Boston to Rockland, ME, received a USDOT subsidy and released its operating costs of  3,350,746.00.7 Implementing an electric aircraft on this route would increase the route s profit by  927,947.50 because of reduced operating costs, increased ownership costs, and reduced maintenance costs, listed and justified in Table 2. As a result, many other smaller, regional routes will become far more profitable with the advancements of electric aircraft. This profit will only increase further due to rising fuel costs from incorporating SAF and recently shut down regional flights, like Houston to College Station, will again be profitable. Because airlines can be significantly more profitable on these routes with electric aircraft than with traditional jets, the US government will probably reduce these subsidies so that operating these routes with electric aircraft is as profitable as with traditional jets. As a result, these subsidies are expected to continue but be reduced, saving the US government around  87M, calculated in Table 3, when airliners switch to electric flights based on today s technology. With a reduction of the subsidy to save the government money that no longer needs to be spent, traditional jets may not be financially feasible to run anymore. Electric aircraft s cost savings will only increase further 5   P a g e with the reduction of battery cost. Hence, many non-existent routes today will appear in the future and significantly boost regional travel. This is exciting news because all of these routes can be carbon-neutral if they are powered by a sustainable energy source. SAFs are expensive. They have not fully taken off because they struggle with the green premium - the cyclical loop of a higher price of something sustainable, such as SAF, due to a lack of supply and logistics systems due to lower demand of the sustainable material because of its high price. Although the price of SAF is expected to decrease due to a reduction in the green premium, an increase in tax credits, advancements of SAF production technology, and widespread adoption of SAFs, electric aircraft will soon dominate the regional markets. Consequently, the airline market may shift away from the point-to-point model driven by advancements in smaller, more fuel-efficient longrange aircraft towards a hub and spoke model, where passengers connect between larger cities to fly to smaller airports. Consequently, our Houston airport will see an increase in regional flights compared to larger, international flights. Passengers flying in and out of smaller airports may pay less to take electric aircraft to nearby larger cities than to fly directly to farther away mid-size cities. For instance, currently, Houston directly connects to small cities like Knoxville TN, Savannah GA, Columbia SC, Grand Rapids MI, Des Moines IA, Kalispell MT, Palm Springs CA, and smaller ski towns in Colorado, among others. Some, if not many, of these flights would no longer be viable - passengers could pay less to fly between Houston and a nearby large city and then connect on a smaller electric or SAF-electric hybrid flight to their target destination city. This would result in larger SAF-fueled airplanes flying between cities on fewer domestic and international flights. SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) Foremost, it is exciting to note that SAF recently achieved the maximum technology readiness level (TRL) of 98. This occurred on December 2, 20219 when a United Airlines B-737 MAX 8 (flight UA 4518) flew from Chicago s O Hare to Washington D.C. s Reagan National Airport with 100  SAF in one of its engines. Although federal regulation limits the maximum percentage of SAF in a flight to 50 , one of the two engines flew entirely on SAF, loopholing this rule and demonstrating pure SAF can power an aircraft engine. Outside of the US, Emirates is fueling one of its B-777-300ER with a pair of GE90 engines that are powered by 100  SAF10 this year. However, due to government regulations and commitments from various airliners, shown in Tables 1.1 and 1.2, the green premium is expected to be reduced. Predominantly first-world, developed countries are listed in these tables because they are the only ones who can afford to bear the prices of the green premium while it remains. As demand for SAF increases, supply will follow, persuading current oil companies and SAF-specific companies, like SkyNRG, Neste, Gevo, and Northwest Advanced Biofuels, to start or increase current SAF production. Once the green premium disappears and SAF becomes competitive or even cheaper than Jet A fuel, many if not all airlines and countries may switch to exclusively SAF. IATA, the International Air Transport Association, estimated only a 2  mix11 of SAF into regular fuels would overcome the green premium. After this amount, costs would be reduced significantly enough12 that demand would increase on its own, breaking the loop of the green premium. This 2  target was aimed to be reached by 2025, but projections show the world will only produce a guaranteed minimum of 85.7  of that 2 , calculated in Table 4, of this target. Regardless, the goal of 2  will be achieved by 2026 and production will take off. There are currently seven ways to produce SAF, listed in Table 5, but only one, HEFA - Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids - is currently commercially viable13. In the next 30 years, other methods may become commercially viable, other production methods may be found, or HEFA may be significantly scaled. Some SAF pathways even have net-negative62 carbon footprints. More research, funding, and attention will be given to SAF production mechanisms following increasing commitments to SAF through government mandates and research and airliner commitments. For wide-scale adoption of SAF throughout US markets, the price of SAF needs to fall to near Jet A fuel or mandates must require 100  SAF by 2050. Regardless, due to increasing mandates of SAF, most if not all airplanes will have full SAF-processing engines by 2050 even if SAF costs more than Jet A fuel. 6   P a g e BATTERIES Battery-powered aircraft at the airport can be utilized for regional flights where SAF or jet-fueled aircraft are not necessary, and possibly more costly. With regards to the consumer side, electric planes may be considered a more luxurious experience than commercial jet fuel planes. Battery-powered flights operate much quieter and feel much less crowded than commercial flights because they have less passenger capacity due to the battery s weight. There are many companies currently working on battery-powered aircraft technology, including companies like Eviation, MagniX, and Pipistrel. Israeli startup Eviation s nine-passenger electric commuter plane, Alice, costs  200 per flight hour to operate, while the same type of plane, a turboprop, powered by jet fuel costs  1,200- 2,000 per flight hour14. However, the most common plane for regional flights is a regular commercial jet fuel plane like the ERJ 145, which costs  3,763 per flight hour and can carry 50 passengers. Comparing the electric and jet fuel planes, the Alice costs about  22 per passenger per hour, and the ERJ 145 costs about  75 per passenger per hour, so the electric plane is still the more economical option. The main challenge of electric aircraft is the weight of the battery needed to provide power, which is why most are smaller and can only go shorter distances. For example, Alice can fly up to 440 nautical miles. This can cover a flight from New York, NY, to Columbus, OH, or Houston, TX to Memphis, TN. According to data from the Department of Transportation, this could cover a significant number of flights. In 2018, 77  of flights in the US were domestic, roughly half of which were regional, so there is a high amount of potential for electric aircraft to be used for these types of flights15. In the Houston area, there are about 32 outgoing regional flights that could be replaced with today s fully electric aircraft, which can be seen in Figure 1. Based on the existing technology such as the Alice, this would require about 26240 kWh day, costing  1960 per day, or about  61 per aircraft per flight. With higher capacity batteries the electricity cost will increase, but this is incredibly reasonable compared to Jet A fuel, which would cost about  6021 for the same flight distance and aircraft capacity. Another challenge is the turnaround time of electric aircraft. Swapping removable plane batteries is a possibility to optimize this process, but we opted to not include them in our design because they will be more expensive than adding charging stations. Although current electric aircraft are only being developed for two-to-six, nine, and nineteen-seat planes, advancements in battery density and weight will make larger electric planes, or at least SAF-electric hybrid aircraft with higher flight duration feasible within the next 30 years. Right now, most electric aircraft use lithium-ion batteries certified for aircraft, which are similar but heavier than the lithium-ion batteries we are familiar with in our phones and computers today. A future contender to lithium-ion batteries is lithium-sulfur batteries, which can have an energy density up to ten times higher than lithium-ion batteries16. It is ahead of other battery technologies such as solidstate batteries or lithium-air batteries, with most at a (TRL) of 517. A conceptual battery-powered aircraft designed by Bauhaus Luftfahrt, a German independent research institution, with a capacity of 189 passengers and a 900 nautical mile range is projected to be possible by 2035. The technology is predicted to be possible if current battery energy density innovations continue at the current rate18. This is exciting because it entails an exponential increase in flight capacity and doubles the current electric flight distance, which would make electric aircraft competitive with non-regional jet fuel airplanes. Eviation predicts it will be able to produce 20-40 passenger electric aircraft within 7- 10 years, easily within the 2050 time period. Alice has already undergone engine testing and as of February 2022, is weeks away from a full flight test19. Also, electric taxiing technology is just around the corner according to IATA, with a TRL of 8. Batteries and electric propulsion systems may not be at TRL 9 yet, but startups like Eviation and MagniX are just a few years away from getting FAA approved, a key step to getting planes in the air. There are many companies actively working on making this technology a reality within a few years, and advances in battery energy density will accelerate this progress. SAFETY OF SAF AND BATTERIES Consumer and support staff safety is a focal point in our design. With the introduction of any new technology, it is necessary to analyze the risk and safety before large-scale use. 7   P a g e SAF Thankfully, SAF fuel uses many of the same safety protocols as traditional Jet A fuel. Given that SAF and traditional jet fuel blends are considered as safe as conventional jet fuel for commercial flights by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), using SAF in planes is not expected to create any new complications with regards to aircraft safety20. However, for this to be true, SAF blends need to comply with ASTM standards which recommend using one of two methods to create the blends1. The first method is mixing pure SAF and pure Jet A fuel on-site at the airport. This is an unfavorable option, as airports would need to invest in new computer software able to frequently measure, monitor, and control the physical and chemical properties of the fuel. Airports with smaller budgets may find it difficult to correctly support this technology and its associated maintenance staff. The second method is purchasing from a third-party fuel refinery that manages the mixing of SAF and Jet A fuel. Because it is unlikely for fuel providers to accept SAF fuel or Jet A fuel refined by competitor companies, SAF blends would need to come from a single source rather than multiple sources. Although this is a small inconvenience, there are multiple companies already producing SAF blends. For example, SG Preston pledges to supply the green airline, JetBlue, with SAF blends supporting JetBlue s sustainability goals21. BATTERIES As expected with quickly growing technologies, lithium-polymer battery efficiencies, safeties, and optimization continue to grow exponentially with research. There will most likely be unforeseen advancements in battery technology that may not be predicted with current and historical exponential growth rates. With that in mind, there are a couple of safety concerns associated with the use of battery-powered aircraft. Among the problems specific to electric aircraft, there are two that stand out the most  battery energy uncertainty and thermal runaway22. Battery energy uncertainty refers to the idea that the exact amount of fuel in a battery is hard to precisely measure. Unlike liquid fuel, one cannot insert a rod into the fuel tank and see how much fuel is inside. For lithium-polymer batteries, their charge capacity is a function of their age, operating temperature, past charge, and usage history. However, this energy uncertainty is an easily preventable problem with many solutions. With improved battery monitoring and record-keeping paired with limiting usage time, the safety concerns associated with this problem are close to zero. Employing pushback tugs, capable of taxiing aircraft to the runway from the gate, will also preserve battery charge. Additionally, with over-designing batteries, therefore increasing their charge capacity, the risk of aircraft exceeding their battery capacity is also greatly reduced. Considering that we expect fixed-wing aircraft to continue being the most common aircraft in 2050, the chances of a fixed-wing aircraft exceeding the most power-demanding stage of flight, takeoff, are minor. The FAA s contingency fuel requirements call for aircraft to reserve 45 minutes of extra fuel in case of wind correction, missed approaches, and flight traffic delays. Applied to battery fuel consumption, pushback tugs and overdesigning batteries will help planes tackle this FAA requirement without sacrificing flight range and flight time. Overall, the energy uncertainty concern is a minor and easy to mitigate safety issue. In comparison to other energy uncertainty concerns, thermal runaway is a risk equally hazardous but less easy to mitigate. Thermal runaway is when an internal short circuit causes battery cells to generate heat, potentially to the point of a fire. Having seen this as a risk for all lithium-polymer batteries, this should come as no surprise to the public, especially because of how the TSA, as well as mail delivery services, emphasize battery hazards. The difference between a tablet catching on fire and the battery of an aircraft is the size. Far more people are exposed to this potential danger than with just a phone or an EV. Although it may seem worrisome, preventative measures such as improving manufacturing and incorporating electrical protection will greatly reduce the probability of occurrence. Much like any other battery, the manufacturing and testing processes are improving every day and the risk of thermal runaway is being mitigated at the source. With incorporating electrical protection around the battery cells and regular battery monitoring, the risk of thermal runaway becomes less and less probable. 8   P a g e AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE (PRESENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONS) Designing the airport of the future requires that we analyze the goals and trajectories of competitor airports. As aircraft technology evolves, so will the airport infrastructure to support innovations and technologies. Many international airports in the US are not only working to accommodate current SAF and electric demands but are also preparing for a zero-emissions future. Today, the nation s largest airports are implementing a range of green initiatives -- a clear manifestation of consumers regarding sustainability as a high priority. Regarding the political landscape, a priority for the Biden Administration has been to give federal grants to airports electrifying their gate support and shuttle buses. Through the FAA s Zero-Emission Vehicles and Infrastructure Pilot Program23, airports can tap into the  300 million budget earmarked for airport infrastructure by the Biden Administration24. Airports such as John Wayne Airport, Indianapolis International Airport, and Charlotte Douglas International Airport are all utilizing electric shuttle buses and investing in renewable infrastructure to support these electric vehicles on-site. For example, high-performance pushback tugs are being employed at Schiphol Airport to push aircraft as big as the 737 to the runway from the gate. These tugs, called taxibots, are capable of speeds up to 23 knots, compared to the 8-knot speed limit of regular tugs. At the forefront of airport technology, these newer tugs require no additional revision to FAA regulations as they comply with current the FAA's Guide to Ground Vehicle Operations23. An investment in electric pushback tugs can greatly reduce the takeoff fuel consumption of planes taxiing to and from the gate. In addition to federal grants, state departments have also awarded increasingly more grants to incentivize airlines to purchase charging stations and electric service vehicles at airports21. Not only are political incentives driving airports towards a SAF and electric-based future, but commercial pressure has increased as well. Regional airlines, focused on serving customers within a locality rather than across the nation, have publicly committed to implementing electric and hybrid aircraft into their fleet. Surf Air has partnered with Cessna to advance the use of hybrid planes as a step towards the company s transition to zero-emission flights in the future25. Companies like Cape Air, Cessna, Textron, and many others are joining Surf Air s shift towards zeroemission travel26. The demand for a zero-emission future has resonated with various airline companies and international airports alike. Major airports have committed to a green future and will allocate their budgets accordingly. With Indianapolis International Airport s largest solar farm at an airport in the world, Salt Lake City International Airport s on-site production of over 6  of their energy from renewable sources, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport s goal of Net Zero Carbon by 2030, and San Diego International Airport s regular sustainability reports 24, it is exciting to see that American airports have carved out a path towards a carbon-neutral future. CONCLUSION Governments and airlines across the world are adopting carbon-neutral policies in all industries. The aviation industry s large carbon footprint especially is catching the public s eyes due to its limited reduction in carbon emissions, making a transition towards carbon-neutral even more important. As a result, the use of SAF and battery electric planes will inevitably be ubiquitous by 2050, as sustainable fuels will be accessible, competitively priced, and integrated into the supply chain. Our 2050 airport provides the infrastructure required for airliners to make these changes through energy optimization at the gates, providing battery-electric aircraft with power, and reducing the fuel consumption of all airplanes. Our airport will support newer airline fleets with asset redesigns and reconfigurations to address the needs of blended-wing aircraft and increased electricity consumption. Our flexible airport design will allow it to take on market changes without outpacing its infrastructure capacity. Once these propositions are completed, this  electric age  will establish a carbon-neutral network that will enable the return of preexisting flights and the commencement of new routes in a more affordable medium without being carbonpositive.",,,,,,
Aluminum Powder Combustion (Boston U),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2023 - ""Clean Aviation Energy""",,"Abstract This report addresses the challenge posed by NASA's 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies  Clean Aviation Energy Competition for which our team must propose an alternative, zero or close-to-zero emissions energy source. Our team has analyzed the carbon footprint of the production and combustion of current-day jet fuel (Jet A), where it was found that the majority of emissions are produced during combustion. The team decided that direct combustion of aluminum powder is the best alternative energy source to meet the competition guidelines. Our team then compared aluminum powder to Jet A and assessed the consequences of different combustion characteristics and aluminum nanoparticle diameters. Overall efficiency calculations demonstrate that aluminum fulfills the energy density requirements while also producing no harmful emissions except for aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and trace amounts of aluminum nitride (AlN), both of which can be captured easily. Current aluminum supply chain metrics were collected, analyzed, and compared to the team s proposed close-to-zero emissions process. The entire process of collecting raw material up to the powderization of aluminum is described, with the team s proposed changes being outlined throughout the paper. Modifications to allow for aluminum powder combustion in current gas turbine engines are outlined and potential solutions and their current readiness levels are listed in order to justify the feasibility of such changes. Increases in aluminum production and infrastructural changes needed to keep up with the recycling of captured alumina is discussed, outlining the aluminum production rates needed to reach the necessary fuel supply by 2050. The need for new engine modifications, research and development, and infrastructural growth is shown in a timeline, providing a general overview of when important milestones should be achieved. The direct carbon emissions released from the team s proposed process demonstrates a 96  decrease without having to drastically change the current aluminum production process. The selection of a set range of particle diameters allows for the aluminum powder to be safely handled without the worry of combusting in air unintentionally, ensuring safe handling from start to finish. An analysis of previous aluminum powder combustion studies, necessary infrastructural changes, and technological advancements provides the team with a strong foundation to claim that the use of aluminum powder as a clean aviation energy source is both feasible and viable by the year 2050. Boston University  Aluminum Powder Combustion 4 1. Introduction With over 4 billion passengers carried in 2019 and supporting around  3.5 trillion in world economic activities, the aviation industry has a significant impact on society  1 ,  2 . However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, enplanements fell 40  from 2019 to 2020, and a full recovery is not expected until the end of 2023  3 ,  4 . Along with this drop in passengers, a subsequent 43  drop in the aviation industry s CO2 emissions occurred  4 . Nonetheless, the Federal Aviation Administration has projected a 185  increase in enplanements from 2020 to 2050, reaching over 1 billion enplanements in the United States alone  3 . Carbon emissions will begin to rapidly outpace technological advancements unless significant changes are made. Using data from The Airline Data Project (ADP), which was established by the MIT Global Airline Industry Program, the average flight time for commercial airlines was calculated to be 2.39 hours (see Appendix D), categorizing the average flight as a short-haul flight  5 . The team is expecting short-haul flights to continue to dominate the aviation industry in 2050, while passengers and flight frequency will continue to increase  5 . With over 60 billion liters of Jet A fuel consumed per year, the aviation industry releases around 920 million metric tonnes (MT) of CO2 into the atmosphere annually, accounting for 2.4  of global emissions and having increased by 30  from 2013 to 2019  6 ,  7 . Table 1 outlines the carbon emissions associated with the production of Jet A fuel, demonstrating that the combustion of Jet A fuel accounts for 83  of CO2 emissions in the entire process  9 ,  10 . In order to solve the growing problem of aircraft CO2 emissions, the discovery of a new clean aviation energy source will need to be implemented. Table 1  Jet A Production Emissions. Jet A CO2 Emissions (kg CO2 kg Jet A) Crude Oil Production 0.37 Refining 0.19 Transportation 0.08 Combustion 3.18 TOTAL 3.82 Sources   7 ,  10 ,  31 . 2. Metrics of Aluminum Powder Combustion In Table 2, the relative mass energy density (specific energy) and volumetric energy densities (energy density) of both aluminum and standard Jet A are shown. The chosen aluminum particle diameter ranges from 50 nm to 50  m in order to stay above the critical particle diameter that causes pyrophoricity (i.e., spontaneous combustion in air) and high particle oxidation rates, and below the maximum particle size above which burn rate drops significantly below 100   11 ,  12 . The values in the table are stated for a particle diameter of 11.7  m, but the values would be similar for any particle in the chosen diameter range. The energy density of such aluminum, as well as its thermal efficiency, are both significantly higher than that of Jet A, whereas the specific energy of aluminum is lower. These factors combine to yield only a small overall decrease in effective specific energy while increasing the overall efficiency by around 11  for our proposed solution. Additionally, the total mass of fuel burned for our proposed energy source is approximately 11  higher than for a comparable flight powered by Jet A. This small decrease in effective specific energy and increase in fuel mass burned is the cost of switching to a fully renewable fuel system by 2050. As shown in Table 2, this fully renewable fuel system will achieve a 96  reduction in emissions as a result of implementing new aluminum production technologies, transitioning to clean renewable energy, and electrifying transportation around the world. The numbers here include both direct and indirect emissions, both of which are discussed in further detail in the following sections. 5 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies  Clean Aviation Energy Competition Table 2  Energy Density Efficiency Comparison.

Aluminum Supply Chain Processes The creation of our proposed aluminum powder is a complex process. It starts out by mining raw bauxite, converting the bauxite to alumina (or aluminum oxide, or Al2O3), converting the alumina to pure aluminum, and then powderizing the aluminum into particles on the nano-micro scale. The process of turning bauxite into alumina is fairly detailed and is referred to as the Bayer Process  8 . It is a sound process that has been used for decades, and we do not foresee any remarkable changes to this process by 2050. A process map depicting this method can be seen in Fig. G.1 in Appendix G. Fig. 1 shows a process map for the Hall H roult and Inert Anode Hall H roult smelting processes to convert alumina to pure aluminum. Alumina can come from the Bayer process, but it may also be taken from the residuals of the powder combustion in a jet engine and be a part of the recycling process. The boxes outlined in green denote the only parts of the process that differentiate the Hall H roult process from the Inert Anode Hall H roult process, which comprise the current and proposed alternative aluminum production methods, respectively. Switching to the inert anode method is how the main harmful emissions are cut out of the process, but this new technology comes at the cost of a larger necessary energy input. CO2, CF4, and C2F6 are released as byproducts in the traditional Hall H roult, whereas in the Inert Anode Hall H roult, only O2 is released from the chamber and can be captured if desired  14 . In either process, the alumina is heated to a molten state and mixed with cryolite in an electrolysis chamber. A carbon anode for the traditional Hall H roult or an inert (possibly made of SnO2) anode for the Inert Anode Hall H roult is then inserted into the mixture. Both processes use similar cathodes  13 . A high current is Figure 1  Process map describing the Hall H roult and Inert Anode Hall H roult smelting process. Boston University  Aluminum Powder Combustion 6 passed through the electrolysis chamber (from the cathode to the anode), and the pure aluminum is collected on the cathode. Inert Anode Hall H roult requires a higher current compared to the carbon-intensive Hall H roult method, which is where the extra energy is needed. The final process is the atomization of aluminum. The aluminum is heated to a molten state and then combined with high-pressure gas or water, which cools the aluminum into small particles by spraying it. The powder is then filtered by diameter, and assuming the diameter is in the proposed range, it can be stored in any container that is convenient and non-porous. During the atomization process, the particles are naturally passivated, meaning that they are non-pyrophoric, which leads to completely safe handling in air  15 . This is due to a thin oxidation layer that forms on the outside of each particle (approximately 2 to 3 nm thick), which has a minimal effect on the thermal efficiency of the aluminum powder combustion, still allowing for a nearly full burn. The volume fraction of the passivation layer to pure aluminum underneath being so small is what allows this. As the particles exceed 100 nm in diameter, the volume fraction of Al2O3 to Al nears 0   15 . At our proposed particle diameter range of 50 nm to 50  m, we can take the volume fraction to be negligible. Fig. G.2 in Appendix G shows a process map describing the above method. The only major technological innovation that our team has proposed for this part of the supply chain is the inert anode used in the Hall H roult process, something that is already being implemented in the aluminum smelting industry. Two companies, ELYSIS (a joint venture between Alcoa and Rio Tinto)  37  and RUSAL  38  have already begun implementing this technology in their smelters. Both companies have pledged to achieve net-zero smelting by 2050 using inert anode technology retrofitted into their current smelters. 4. Aluminum Supply Chain Emissions Analysis Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate the key metrics of each step in the aluminum supply chain for the current process and the proposed process, respectively. In our proposed process, smelting is slightly more efficient and the smelting and atomization are both completed in the same facility. In this way, the powderization process can reach nearly 100  yield as the out of spec particles can be added back into the alumina to primary aluminum process and re-atomized. As a result, the alumina, primary aluminum, and powderization processes are more mass efficient. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the team s proposed process for aluminum powder production reduces direct CO2 emissions by 99.3  and indirect CO2 emissions by 96.6 . However, there are several crucial infrastructural and technological changes that need to be made in order to assume a zero-emissions transportation and energy sector by the year 2050. While the direct emissions released from the process can be eliminated through the use of new refining technologies, electricity consumption releases a large amount of indirect emissions, especially in the alumina and primary aluminum production phases. Table 3  Current Aluminum Production Output, Energy Consumption, and Emissions.

As seen in Table 3, indirect emissions associated with the electrolysis process are significantly higher than the rest of the process emissions combined, as indirect CO2 emissions from energy production 7 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies  Clean Aviation Energy Competition accounts for 88  of the process and will need to be addressed to create a close-to-zero carbon supply chain  16 . In order to address these issues, it is important to review the long term strategies for decarbonization of the energy sector submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Focusing specifically on the United States Decarbonization Plan submitted in 2021, there are several zero-carbon goals set out for electricity production and transportation. The United States set a goal to reach an electricity system 100  free of carbon pollution by 2035, which will be achieved through investments in solar, wind, nuclear, and battery technologies. With this new electricity system, indirect energy emissions can be significantly reduced, as shown in Table 4. To assume the elimination of transportation emissions in Table 4, the same plan is referred to, as the United States seeks to invest in the development of low-to-zero-carbon fuels for long-distance freight shipping along with electrifying ground transportation  18 . While this submission is solely focused on the United States, there are 57 other submissions from countries around the world, showing a unified effort to reduce carbon emissions in all sectors by the year 2050  19 .

Engine Analysis In addition to purely energy-related considerations, it is important to understand how using aluminum will impact current engines in order to qualify the feasibility of this concept. In studies such as Pradhap et al.  28  and Mandilas et al.  29 , there have been successful attempts to design an aluminum-powered, air-ingesting motor. While there was no complete engine built for the analysis, the concept has been modeled successfully. To provide a general overview of our proposed process, the aluminum powder fuel is stored as a pure product and burns via the air ingested by the jet engine. Thus, the pure Al powder will primarily react with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form Al2O3 and, in extremely small amounts, AlN as it combusts  20 . These two byproducts need to be captured before the expanding air in the combustion chamber enters the turbine. Although, this does mean that there is added complexity to the engine, and flight calculations will no longer allow for a constant decrease in plane mass as fuel is burned off, but rather an increased mass due to the higher mass of Al2O3 over pure Al, the advantage of complete Al2O3 recyclability is still much desirable. To help ease the transition from Jet A to aluminum powder, it is important to understand what changes will need to be made to accommodate this new fuel source. The team's design strategy aimed to maintain the existing gas turbine engine components as much as possible, while minimizing necessary alterations. As shown in Fig. 2, current gas turbine engines will need to be modified to allow the combustion of aluminum powder. The fuel injection system, ignition method, combustor, and high-pressure turbine are all current components that will require some change. While the particle separator is a component that is currently being used in select engines, it has only been used in the diffuser rather than after the combustor  49 . However, the team s proposed modifications allow for Boston University  Aluminum Powder Combustion 8 several sections of the conventional gas turbine engine to remain the same, such as the diffuser, compressor, low-pressure turbine, and exhaust nozzle. The following analysis will focus on each system which requires a modification, listing out several potential solutions for each system and grading them based on a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to evaluate feasibility (see Appendix H). Figure 2  Modified gas turbine engine process map (green indicates changes relative to current designs). 5.1. Fuel Injection Transitioning from liquid to solid fuel, engine suppliers will need to consider changes to the fuel pump and injection nozzle, as the aluminum particles can abrasively damage these components and will not spread into a fine mist through the injection nozzle  51 . For micro-sized and nano-sized aluminum particles, agglomeration of the particles is also a major concern. If particles clump together, the specific surface area of the agglomerated large particle is decreased, which in turn lowers the reactivity of the metal and decreases combustion performance  11 . While current injection nozzles allow liquid fuel to be atomized into a fine mist capable of producing a uniform combustion profile, a similar system of dispersing solid particles will need to be implemented for proper aluminum powder combustion  50 . Commercially available methods of dispersing metal powders do currently exist and are used in laboratory settings. These solid fuel injection systems involve a Venturi tube wherein high-velocity air flow creates a low-pressure zone capable of sucking powder from a holding chamber into the high-velocity air flow, mixing it. This mixture of air and powder creates an aluminum powder aerosol that advantageously sends a homogenous mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber, helping to reduce the agglomeration of particles  52 . Because of this system's wide use in commercial and laboratory applications, our team believes that engineers can easily convert it, using readily-available high-speed air during flight to properly inject our fuel and implement effective mass-flow and air-fuel ratio controls. Studies have demonstrated the benefits that premixing fuel and air has on NOx emissions reduction  53 , but these studies are primarily focused on current jet fuels. The team expects the engine body geometry to be slightly altered to accommodate this new fuel injection system, and the additional air flow needed for this system may result in slight pressure drops in the core bypass flow, but we believe all modifications will fit within the parameters of pre-designed nacells. Overall, the team believes that this method of fuel injection is feasible but will require further research and development, categorizing this solution as TRL 4  54 . 5.2. Fuel Ignition Ignition systems in modern aircraft engines must be capable of supplying sufficient ignition energy, establishing a flame throughout the combustor, and relighting in the case of combustor flame-out. Due to the low ignition temperature of Jet A, aircraft engines make use of spark plugs to generate a spark capable of igniting the fuel-air mixture and fulfill the previously mentioned ignition system requirements  50 . However, the use of aluminum powder requires using an ignition source capable of producing much 9 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies  Clean Aviation Energy Competition higher temperatures because the combustion reaction of aluminum can only begin once the aluminum oxide layer is melted, exposing the inner aluminum to air and beginning the autoignition process  55 . This ignition temperature is also dependent on the particle size, as combustion studies have shown that ignition temperature decreases with decreasing particle size, ranging from 3770  F at a particle diameter of 10  m to 1219  F at a particle diameter of 100 nm  55 . The appeal of an elegant, high-energy igniter capable of producing ignition in unfavorable aerodynamic conditions has been the inspiration of multiple solutions that the team believes can be used to reach the higher ignition temperatures required for aluminum powder. During several laboratory experiments of metal powder combustion, an oxyacetylene torch was used to begin the high temperature initial reaction  52 . Outside of the laboratory, patents for torch igniter designs in commercial aircraft engines have been filed and exchanged by large aerospace companies, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne, Pratt   Whitney, and Boeing  57 . Experimentation of a liquid and gaseous methane oxygen torch igniter for rocket propulsion systems has been extensively studied and produces flame temperatures over 4940  F  58 . Engineers must consider the type of oxidizer and fuels used and ensure that their byproducts would not interfere with the aluminum-air mixture in the combustor. Another high energy igniter currently being experimented with in aircraft engines are plasma igniters. Plasma jet ignition devices produce high-velocity, high-temperature flame kernels capable of traveling through the fuel-air mixture and demonstrate better performance characteristics than conventional spark plug ignition systems  56 . The team expects slight combustion chamber modifications to fit the new ignition system housing and the additional fuel oxidizer storage and control components. This solution can be categorized as TRL 6 for both ignition methods due to the extensive research and recent prototype testing. For smaller size aluminum particles, less intensive ignition methods are required due to the lower ignition temperature of around 1219  F, meaning that more conventional ignition systems can be retained or slightly modified. With this smaller particle size, the ignition system can be categorized as TRL 8, which can further be raised after use in a successful mission  59 . 5.3. Combustion Chamber For the combustion chamber, factors such as the fuel adiabatic flame temperature, cooling methods, and material selection all need to be considered when determining the most efficient combustor design. The adiabatic flame temperature of Jet A fuel and aluminum when combusted in air is about 3680  F and 5923  F, respectively  55 ,  60 . One viable method to bring flame temperatures down and minimize the needed combustion chamber modifications is to use a smaller particle size. Several laboratory experiments have shown that using micro-sized aluminum particles or larger produce flame temperatures of around 5431 to 6380  F when combusted in air at 1 atm. These experiments tested the same sized particles while varying pressure and oxygen percentage, showing higher flame temperatures with increasing ambient pressure and oxygen percentage  55 ,  61 . Aluminum nanoparticles demonstrated much lower flame temperatures, even in higher oxygen percentage and ambient pressure conditions. The study of an 80-nm aluminum particle during combustion demonstrated that for an environment at 50  oxygen percentage and 4 atm, the flame temperature ranged from 2600 to 4220  F, which is much lower than the previously listed flame temperatures  61 . Assuming that the turbine inlet temperature is the same as the previously listed flame temperatures, this inlet temperature can be reduced from 3680 to 2600  F, decreasing the engine s TSFC substantially by around 10  by correlating a 100  F decrease in inlet temperature to about a 1  decrease in TSFC  89 . While changing the particle size affects factors such as burn time, particle agglomeration, and volume fraction of Al2O3 to Al, engineers working on the implementation of aluminum powder can take advantage of several of the previously mentioned properties. Designing sections of the combustor to have lower or higher oxygen percentages for optimal combustion efficiency as is commonly done today  50  along with choosing an optimal particle size enables engineers to mimic flame temperature properties of Jet A fuel and allows for the combustor to maintain similar wall cooling flow and mixing before the hot gasses reach the turbine inlet. The team believes that the combustor can be categorized as TRL 4, as these combustion tests are validated in a laboratory environment. Further testing and research is required to fully implement this fuel source into a modified gas turbine engine, mainly focusing on testing Boston University  Aluminum Powder Combustion 10 performance characteristics of varying particle sizes. The team has also researched several new cooling methods focusing on materials selection, airflow manipulation using latticework ducts, and regenerative cooling techniques  62 ,  63 . By 2050 it is assumed that more effective and capable cooling methods will be available for use in gas turbine engines, however the team believes that the current most feasible way to control combustion chamber temperatures without introducing new complex materials and cycle complexity is to manipulate the particle size and chamber oxygen percentages. 5.4. Particle Separation The particle separation system is necessary to remove and capture all of the alumina particles that are produced in the combustion chamber. There are two methods that we believe can be feasibly incorporated into an engine. The first method is attaching a particle separator that is traditionally used to remove sand and debris ingested into the engine as described in the  Integral Engine Inlet Particle Separator Design Guide   49 . This system works by giving the particle-air mixture a centrifugal force to move the particles to the outer edges and then forcing the flow to turn. The subsonic air would be able to make the turn, but the high forward momentum and radial distance from the bend would not allow the alumina particles to make the turn, sending them into the removal ducts. In Fig. 3, the path each part of the flow would follow is shown. The data in the paper suggests that this can be at least 95  effective in capturing alumina based on the weight and particle size, which is a reasonable effectiveness. Alumina has a density over double that of typical sand used in the paper and would have over twice the momentum for a particle of the same size as a result, leading to an even higher expected efficiency  70 ,  71 . The main problems with this concept are the necessary incorporation of swirl and de-swirl vanes immediately after the combustor. This would lower the efficiency of the turbine as the flow would be interrupted before it reaches the blades. Additionally, the blades will be subjected to the extremely high temperature of the flow as it exits the combustor. Furthermore, the swirl vane would have erosion issues and need constant surveillance and maintenance to ensure no major issues occur. While all of these issues may have solutions, the team does not have the means to properly explore and qualify them, as physical testing would be necessary to determine all the details of separating high-temperature, high-momentum alumina particles. The team is confident in categorizing this method as TRL 6 as particle separation technology has been tested and implemented in jet engines for decades. The only obstacles to overcome technologically are core geometry changes and component temperature resilience. Both issues are not unique to this system, and we believe this would qualify as having a fully-functional prototype. Figure 3 (Left)  Particle separator diagram  49 . Figure 4 (Right)  Reverse flow combustor diagram  72 . Blue arrows show the path of alumina-air mixture, red arrows show the path of the separated alumina, and green arrows show the path of clean air. The second method of particle separation the team identified is a modification to the combustor, primarily its geometry. A standard combustor may be modified into a reverse-flow combustor and achieve the same particle filtration effect as described earlier using the centrifugal method, with only slight modifications. While reverse-flow combustors are typically used in smaller engines, they have the potential to be useful here as well  72 . By utilizing the  S -shaped turn and taking advantage of the flow s swirl, it may be 11 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies  Clean Aviation Energy Competition possible to separate the alumina particles from the air flow using the same momentum-based principle as in the first method. This can be better seen in Fig. 4, which shows the proposed particle paths in a generalized reverse-flow combustion chamber diagram. The team is confident in assigning TRL 2 as there is currently no publicly-accessible research on particle capturing technology inside of a reverse-flow combustor and our analysis is highly speculative. For either method, a pressure gradient would need to be established to ensure all particles enter the holding chamber with some type of added check valve to eliminate the possibility of the particles reentering the core flow and being discharged out of the nozzle into the atmosphere. Both also create significant geometric changes, which may have an impact on the high pressure turbine design. While this is uncertain, it is something worth considering. 5.5. NOx Emissions The combustion of aluminum in an ambient air environment produces trace amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx). NOx emissions are known toxins  provisions to lower their emissions or mitigate their effects are necessary. There are two paths to lowering emissions  (1) reduce the quantity of NOx particulates generated in the combustion process or (2) remove generated NOx particulates from the exhaust flow. Current research into metal powder combustion has shown that in the case of magnesium (Mg) powder combustion in air an energetically similar combustion process to Al in air NOx emissions remain equal to or lower than emissions from gasoline-based combustion processes  73 . In the worst case, NOx emissions will remain equal in quantity to current emissions. However, emissions generation can be reduced by controlling the aluminum combustion temperatures and the air-fuel ratio. A well known method called exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) may be used to lower the temperature in the combustion chamber by returning some of the exhaust gas back into the combustor inlet, thus acting as a diluent to the main air stream entering the combustion chamber. A greater volume of air increases the aluminum particle burn rate, which in turn decreases overall combustion temperature  74 . Decreasing combustion temperatures has been shown to significantly reduce NOx formation  73 . Although EGR creates more losses in the exhaust, it may be necessary to reduce NOx emissions. Any temperature decrease must also be balanced with the decrease in combustion efficiency that lower temperatures yield. Nevertheless, EGR is an already widely used technology that could be readily implemented into a turbofan engine, so the team evaluates this technology as TRL 8. The second method is to simply remove any solid NOx particulates from the exhaust stream using the existing aluminum particle separation system. According to the EPA, the smallest particles that  have shown toxicity have a diameter of about 3  to 5  of the wavelength of any color of visible light   75 , which translates to a minimum particle size of 11.4 nm. The existing alumina particle separator would be able to filter these small NOx particles, but with a lower capture rate due to the smaller particle size. This system would advantageously require no additional modifications to the engine alongside those needed for the alumina particle separator. Overall, Appendix I outlines each engine component along with the proposed changes, features, challenges, and assigned TRL levels to highlight the main areas of interest for engine modifications. 6. Production Rate Analysis (Present 2050) Appendix E shows that 100 million MTAl is needed to produce enough fuel for the United States  current commercial aviation industry. It is also estimated that 80  more aluminum is needed for other industries. Fortunately, the extra 100 million MTAl is not per year but merely a one-time starting number due to the proposed recycling methods. As long as that amount can be saved by 2050, much less new aluminum will need to be added. During the aluminum combustion, the only substantial byproduct is Al2O3, with AlN being created only in trace amounts  30 . For the purpose of this analysis, we have assumed that  trace amounts  means less than 5 . This means only 5 million MTAl would need to be added per year, with the rest being recycled. This works out to be an average production rate of 127 million MTAl per year by 2050, as long as 100 million MTAl is saved between 2023 and 2050. Fig. 5 shows the total amount of aluminum we propose needs to be produced compared to what would only meet predicted market demands. The Boston University  Aluminum Powder Combustion 12 deviation in the plot is extremely small. Fig. 6 shows the rate of aluminum production per year. We propose a greater increase in production in the middle years as it will be easier to increase the rate of production and renormalize it to what is only needed to meet other consumer demand and non-recycled aluminum. Fig. 7 shows this process as well, as seen by the curve in the rate of change increasing initially, and then decreasing lower than would be needed for only consumer demand. This allows for a smaller ratio of rate of change to rate of production, which is an easier goal to reach. The main point is that 127 million MTAl will need to be produced per year in 2050 with an additional 100 million MTAl stored for use as fuel in order to meet consumer demand exclusively. Separate facilities will need to be created to handle alumina recycling beyond 2050, the cost of which is analyzed in an upcoming section. Figure 5 (Left)  Projected total amount of aluminum produced after 2023 for each year. Figure 6 (Middle)  Projected rate of aluminum production after 2023 for each year. Figure 7 (Right)  Projected rate of change of aluminum production after 2023 for each year. 7. Timeline The timeline presented in Fig. 8 is a culmination of technological and infrastructure advancements that need to be made leading up to 2050 in order for the source-to-flight lifecycle of aluminum powder to be very close to net-zero carbon emissions. Renewable energy and net-zero emissions from other modes of transportation are pivotal for the mitigation of carbon emissions throughout the team s proposed process. Industrial-scale use of the inert anode technology required in the primary aluminum production phase will eliminate the majority of direct CO2 emissions from the process. Figure 8  Timeline of technological advancements, infrastructural changes, and production milestones. Ensuring that modified aircraft and engines are FAA certified within a reasonable timeframe is necessary to justify that these new aluminum-powered aircraft will be ready for commercial use by 2050. The team believes that the two most important and applicable sections of the FAA aircraft certification 13 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies  Clean Aviation Energy Competition process are FAR Part 25 and 33, which stipulate the requirements for aircraft and engine readiness, respectively  82 ,  83 . To determine a reasonable timeline for these certifications, the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX is used as reference. For minor changes, the FAA issues an amended type certificate, which typically takes 3 to 5 years to complete. For comparison, the certification of a new aircraft type can take between 5 to 9 years  84 . As such, the team believes the certification of this new aircraft type will take approximately 9 years, and should be started no later than 2035 once engine modifications are finalized. Fuel procurement may also need to be addressed, as some of the largest alumina manufacturers are based in China, Russia, India, and Brazil  41 . If aluminum powder fuel becomes a viable energy source for the entire aviation industry, it is possible that the price and availability of aluminum from those countries may fluctuate significantly. However, this has been neglected for the following cost analysis. 8. Cost Analysis A cost for implementation of the supply chain can be estimated by adding up the most significant upfront and recurring costs. Upfront costs include the costs to build new aluminum plants, source the aluminum, conduct new engine research, and retrofit aircraft with the modified engines. The dominant recurring cost is the cost of electricity (included in the cost of fuel). Other recurring costs are set by the cost of smelter maintenance (i.e., cost to replace anode and cathode of the electrolytic cells, also in the cost of fuel), engine maintenance, labor, and transportation. The estimated upfront and recurring costs are  785 billion and  178 billion per year, respectively. Table 5 summarizes all the aforementioned costs. See Appendix B for more details on how each estimate was determined. In order to reach a point of profitability, further extreme cost-reducing factors must be explored. This can be achieved through energy contracts, government subsidies, or decreases in raw material costs for smelter equipment. Table 5  Cost Summary.

Conclusion Overall, the team has demonstrated the potential that aluminum powder has to supersede the use of Jet A in the aviation industry. With a 96  reduction in emissions, minimal changes to the current aluminum production chain, and comparable propulsive capabilities to Jet A with additional benefits, aluminum powder is capable of becoming a mainstream alternative aviation energy source. To further validate the feasibility of this alternative fuel source, the team has presented a modified gas turbine engine capable of handling the combustion and filtering of solid fuel while addressing the main difficulties associated with burning aluminum powder. The cost summary demonstrates that the total upfront and recurring costs associated with transitioning and using this new fuel source is significantly larger than the costs associated with using Jet A fuel. However, steps in the future can be taken to improve the recurring costs by reducing the smelter operating costs and utilizing cheaper renewable energy. Being able to retrofit current airplanes with modifications to handle aluminum powder combustion, significantly reduce harmful emissions, and minimally change the current supply chain are all areas where the team believes this solution will truly stand out, making it the best potential candidate as the clean aviation energy source of the 2050s and beyond.",,,,,,
Aircraft Propulsion by Directed Energy Beam Bursts (UC San Diego),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2023 - ""Clean Aviation Energy""",,"1 Abstract  Directed energy beaming is a promising technology solution for the pursuit of near-zero emissions in the commercial aviation industry by the year 2050. In the context of sustainable aviation, directed energy beaming involves the generation of a high-energy laser at an external power station, utilizing renewable energy sources in the process. The laser is then aimed and beamed to an aircraft in flight, where its energy is used either to activate photovoltaic cells to charge batteries that power propellers, or to power a  laser turbofan,  in which the laser energy heats air that is then expelled out of a nozzle to produce thrust. Laser power beaming provides airlines with higher energy density than solar power, 24-hour operational capabilities, and increased payload or lighter aircraft, all while having the capacity to be generated from fully renewable energy sources. The team proposes the construction of ground-based laser beaming stations along popular domestic flight routes within the next ten to fifteen years, powered with renewable energy sources such as solar, geothermal, or nuclear. Once the viability of the technology has been proven, international government entities can collaborate with private spaceflight and aviation industries to develop and deploy a series of space-based relay and power satellites by the year 2050, thereby significantly increasing the system s range of support. Much of the necessary technology for such a proposal is currently available or in development, although much work remains in terms of guaranteeing operational safety, garnering public acceptance, and securing support from the spacefaring nations of the world. Nevertheless, the team optimistically predicts that the aviation landscape of 2050 would not only support, but thrive under the possibilities offered by laser power beaming technology.   2 Introduction  An article published in a 1979 issue of the journal Aeronautics and Astronautics titled  Laser Aircraft  opens with a bold claim   A 300-airplane fleet with transcontinental range would save enough kerosene to equal the energy content of the entire system, including power and relay satellites, in one year   1 . In order to meet the goal of zero-emissions operations by the year 2050, the aviation industry will need to aggressively adapt to a range of innovative, sustainable technologies and practices. In this proposal, the student team at the University of California, San Diego explores how one such novel technology, Aircraft Propulsion by Directed Energy Beam Bursts (DEB-B), could be implemented into the aviation landscape by 2050. The source-to-flight lifecycle, safety concerns, readiness levels, and impacts of the technology from environmental, industrial, financial, and sociopolitical perspectives are discussed. Laser power beaming is simple conceptually. First, a high-energy beam of light is generated at a power station (which is itself powered by a renewable energy source such as solar, geothermal, or nuclear). The laser is then aimed and beamed to an aircraft mid-flight. The energy contained within this laser provides the sole source of energy for the propulsion of the aircraft. Laser power is proposed over solar as it is more concentrated, can be captured more efficiently than the full spectrum of visible light, and can operate in a wider range of environmental conditions. The team has identified two proposed propulsion methods in this regard  first, the lasers may be directed at photovoltaic cells that charge batteries to power propellers  or second, the laser energy may heat air that is then expelled out of a nozzle to produce thrust (as specified in the competition guidelines, however, the specifics of the storage and use of the energy source once it has reached the aircraft will not be the focus of this proposal). The team would like to note that throughout this proposal, the terms  laser  and  directed energy  are used interchangeably. The team s initial concept utilized visible- or near-visible light lasers, but subsequent literature review has indicated the feasibility of using microwave lasers (masers) to achieve similar or better results. This prompted the inclusion of the more general term  directed energy.  3 Technical Approach and Justification Despite never receiving mainstream attention, power beaming has long been considered a promising technology by many bright minds in government and industry. Publicly available records proposing laser power as a means of commercial aviation propulsion date back to 1976  2 . Although some preliminary research was published in the late 1970s and 80s, it was not until 2003 that the first true demonstration of laser-powered flight was performed by NASA engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center.  3   4 . Since then, various power beaming directives have been funded, mostly in the defense sector, but the technology has been mostly absent from the public eye with regard to commercial aviation  5   6   7   8 . Over 40 years of technological development have occurred since the most in-depth studies on power beaming for commercial aviation purposes were published. The team was motivated to pursue this proposal topic due to both the apparent promise of energy beaming as a near-zero emissions technology, and the lack of recent research focusing on its application in the commercial sector. 3.1 System Overview US airlines hosted 1 billion passengers on over 10 million flights in 2019  9 . The demand for air travel is only increasing it is expected that the annual global number of aviation passengers will reach 9 billion by the year 2050  10 . Any system intended to replace the fossil fuel propulsion systems powering these flights would need to be massive in scale. The team s proposed solution would consist of a global array of directed power beaming stations, both ground- and space-based, along with a fleet of aircraft modified to receive power from said stations. The sizing of this system is discussed in Section 4.2 and Appendix A. 3 The implementation of a power beaming system would consist of three  phases  between the modern day and the year 2050. Each phase represents an increase in scale, cost, and technological challenge and would thus be implemented chronologically.  Phase I  would be a ground-to-aircraft system powered by ground stations,  Phase II  a ground-to-space-to-aircraft system incorporating relay satellites, and  Phase III  a satellite-powered space-to-aircraft system. See Figure 3.a for a graphical depiction. 3.2 Aircraft One potential design for a laser-powered aircraft involves the use of laser turbofans and receiving dishes. A laser turbofan would consist of typical turbomachinery and a heat exchanger to convert laser energy to thermal energy for the heating of air. Such a device could be incorporated into a traditional kerosene-burning turbofan, allowing it to carry a fuel reserve on which to operate in emergencies. A receiving dish would be mounted onto or incorporated Figure 3.a  A visual representation of the three proposed DEB-B phases. into the aircraft body. Figure 3.b shows two potential designs  one being a modern aircraft retrofitted with a laser turbofan system, the other a novel aircraft design with a receiving dish incorporated into the airframe. Yet another design would be to place the laser receiving dishes directly on the engines. This on-wing concept is the most heavily considered in this paper. A laser turbofan would consist of typical turbomachinery and a heat exchanger to convert laser energy to thermal energy. Such a device could reasonably be incorporated into a pre-existing kerosene-burning turbofan. Such laser-powered aircraft would still carry small fuel reserves and maintain their ability to be powered by traditional combustion technology, to be activated only for an emergency landing in case of a tracking failure or loss of the supporting power station. Such redundancy would be prudent until the DEB-B system obtains redundant tracking coverage and is proven reliable beyond a reasonable doubt. A second design involves beaming energy to photovoltaic cells on the aircraft which charge batteries to power electric propellers. The ideal laser-powered aircraft would be capable of receiving energy from either ground or space-based stations to avoid the costs of certifying two different designs, one with the receiving hardware atop the aircraft and one with it below. Further analysis would need to be performed to determine viability of a singular design in terms of weight and complexity. Figure 3.b  Two proposed power beaming aircraft designs from Hertzberg and Sun (1979). 4 3.3 Takeoff and Landing Powering aircraft during takeoffs and landings with the DEB-B system pose unique challenges. Depending on the mode of laser-powered propulsion that is implemented, the power sources discussed in following subsections may be inadequate for supplying an aircraft s energy needs during these critical phases of flight  as such, alternative options should be considered. An electrically powered aircraft would not need any special laser beaming requirements during takeoff or landing, as a small onboard battery could provide enough power for that purpose. However, a turbofan engine would require a novel method for beaming energy, especially during takeoff. For this purpose, the team proposes the utilization of a line of lasers embedded in the runway pointing directly up at the engines to provide continuous power as the aircraft lifts off the runway. This line of runway lasers would not need much precision as the aircraft is generally constrained to the runway. They would begin to be built during Phase I, with installations at key airports first. If this system were deemed unfeasible, then runways could instead be outfitted with existing technologies such as Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) to launch aircraft. 3.4 Phase I  Ground Stations In Phase I, a series of ground-based power stations, with redundant coverage for safety purposes, would be built along one or more popular air traffic routes (see Appendix A.3 for an example route). Each ground station would consist of an orientable Megawatt laser, receiving and tracking systems, a secondary scanning system (see Section 3.6), and integration with one or more forms of renewable energy. Upon obtaining a secure lock of a target aircraft, the laser would transmit a constant beam of energy to be captured by the aircraft. It would simultaneously receive a stream of data from the aircraft to maintain a successful lock and scan the surrounding air for signs of potential obstructions. When the target aircraft reaches too low of an angle for safe or efficient beaming, the laser would be powered off and the station would be redirected to a new target. The main limitation of ground stations is their immobility, which limits the range and flexibility of flight paths and makes transoceanic flights practically impossible  as such, it is expected that Phase I would provide coverage only over a select set of popular routes. Their main role would be as a logistical stepping stone to space-based station deployment, proving technological viability while being cheaper to build  restrictions on weight, volume, and dimensions would also be less stringent. Ease of access for maintenance and integration to power sources make their lifecycle effectively unlimited. Another significant consideration is the relative ease of gaining public and political support for a ground-based system before introducing a space-based counterpart. Even after their functionality is replaced by later phases, ground stations could be kept in operation for redundant coverage or to beam power to line-of-sight terrestrial locations. 3.5 Phase II  Relay Satellites The second step toward developing a power beaming system would be the deployment of a relay satellite network in elliptical orbits. Following a Lockheed design, a beam reaches the satellite and first reflects off of a large flexible receiving mirror  11 . It is then focused toward one or more transfer mirrors which correct any aberrations and provide feedback to the receiving mirror on necessary shape corrections. The beam is then redirected and beamed to its final target. The remaining satellite components include the transmitter structure, control gyroscopes, and fine actuators for the receiving mirror. By having ground stations beam energy to relay satellites, the range of coverage for target aircraft would be greatly increased, but still limited. The effect on pointing and tracking accuracy due to atmospheric turbulence also becomes a concern. A third evolution of the system is thus warranted. 3.6 Phase III  Power Satellites The final step in the implementation of a comprehensive power beaming system would be the introduction of space-based power satellites in sun-synchronous orbits consisting of a closed-cycle laser, power generation systems, and necessary optics. Power could be generated with solar-powered thermal engines, photovoltaic cell arrays, or nuclear energy. The use of both relay and power satellites would 5 decrease sizing, cost, and accuracy restrictions compared to a system using solely power satellites  11   12 . By beaming from orbit to aircraft flying at 10 km or higher, the thickest regions of the atmosphere, and thus the greatest tracking challenges, would be avoided. A proposed design for a power satellite is shown in Figure 3.c. 3.7 Safety As with any other aeronautical or astronautical endeavor, the deployment of laser beaming technology must be performed with safety as the top priority. Laser technology s most attractive benefit  its ability to produce and transmit concentrated energy at the speed of light  is also its most serious concern from a safety standpoint. Two main questions arise in the discussion of power beaming safety  first, what if the laser beam should accidentally miss its target or have its line of sight obstructed by another object? Second, what if the power stations were hijacked and used as weapons? Figure 3.c  A proposed design for a power satellite from Hertzberg and Sun (1979). Ground- and space-based power stations each introduce their own set of inadvertent targets in the event of an obstruction or tracking failure. For ground stations, the greatest concern is animals and other aircraft. Space-based stations may be obstructed by orbital debris or other satellites  additionally, the risk associated with a tracking failure is greatly increased due to the beam being pointed toward the Earth rather than into the atmosphere. In both cases, there is also a risk of the laser breaching the target aircraft and affecting the passengers and crew. The second question, regarding the use of directed energy for nefarious purposes, poses a more wide-scale threat. Although nothing resembling a true  laser weapon  has ever been utilized on a battlefield, U.S. military investigation of high-energy laser weapons dates back to the Cold War and continues to the modern day  13   14   15 . It will be assumed for the sake of this proposal that DEB-B represents the first deployment of a space-based directed energy device with the capability to harm equipment or personnel. A rigorous body of technological safety features would need to be integrated into the system to protect against both accidental and intentional misuse of DEB-B. One such feature, as noted by Jin and Zhou, is a secondary Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) scanning system  to shut off the system as soon as an animal or aircraft approaches the beam, and then quickly reacquire the target when it is clear.   16  Another crucial system function would be its ability to shut off in the case of any failure to obtain a secure tracking lock on a target aircraft. Another solution could be opting for a laser configuration that limits maximum terrestrial power propagation levels to within safe margins. The system from Hertzberg et al., for example, would deposit a maximum of around 1 Joule per square centimeter (J cm2) to the ground on a clear day, which is below the threshold for skin burns at 6 J cm2  3 . It is, however, above the threshold for retinal burns, although the authors indicate that their system s ability to terminate the laser beam less than 100 milliseconds after a tracking lock failure, along with the improbability of a person looking directly into the beam during perfect optical conditions as it sweeps the ground at approximately 960 kilometers per hour,   reduce  the probability of eye damage to an infinitesimal level.  Such power limitations, however, would be at the expense of the system s ability to provide propulsive energy and might prove too restrictive to be viable. To complement these safety features, a series of political protocols would also be necessary to guarantee safe operation  this will be discussed in Section 5.4. 6 4 Aviation Landscape of 2050 As noted in Section 3.1, it is expected that the aviation industry will grow significantly by 2050 as a natural extension of the world s growing interconnectedness. Globalization will continue to drive up both the number of flying passengers and the demand for international freight transport, further instigating the need for eco-friendly flight systems. Between modern day and 2050, changes in the aviation landscape are expected to be driven mainly by cost increases in traditional aviation fuel due to dwindling resources and federal regulations, evolving aircraft designs, and a general increase in public desire for environmentally friendly travel. Increases in traditional aviation fuel costs are expected to be driven more by federal regulation than by scarcity. Federal incentive programs such as the European Union s  carbon tax  on airlines will likely become commonplace tactics for promoting a shift to zero-emissions operation  17 . The aircraft industry of 2050 is expected to be supported by a US power grid that has been massively upgraded to support the dominance of electric vehicles and other forms of electrification  18 . This includes significant development in nuclear energy, which would be the most promising energy source for ground-based power beaming stations. Efficiency-driven changes in aircraft form factor are predicted, some of which would integrate especially well with the design changes presented in Section 3.2. One example is the increasingly popular blended wing  the increased surface area would simplify the incorporation of a receiving dish. 4.1 Technology Readiness Levels The readiness levels of the technologies relevant to a power beaming system vary greatly. In general, the technology related to the high-power directed energy devices would require the most development. Other technologies, such as those contained in the optics and tracking subsystems, are already demonstrated or feasible with modern techniques. Technology, manufacturing, and supply chain readiness levels are discussed below, and summarized in Figure 4.a. The first technological hurdle facing the implementation of a power beaming system is the development of a sufficiently powerful and compact laser. Any commercial aircraft has a continuous power requirement in the range of tens of megawatts, which no (declassified) laser system outside of laboratories has yet obtained  1 . However, lasers have seen rapid development in their relatively short lifespan. American Scientist reports that  the peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased by roughly a factor of 1,000 every 10 years.   19  Considering that Chinese researchers have already claimed to have developed satellite-deployable directed energy devices with power capabilities of 1-5 Megawatts, it is reasonable to predict that power beaming systems powerful enough to support DEB-B could be produced within the next 10-15 years with sufficient funding and focus  20 . The literature remains divided on the optimal type of laser for power beaming applications. The large body of literature surrounding lasers, along with the field s rapid pace of research, makes it difficult to provide confident speculations as to the state of the technology in 2050 and the most promising lasing medium for power beaming applications. Fiber, diode, solid-state, and free electron laser systems were investigated  16   21   22   for the sake of this proposal, however, the team chose to focus on a laser system inspired by Hertzberg and Sun s analyses of the late 1970s, by far the most technically detailed of their kind  2   3 . Such a system would be powered by a 40-Megawatt 5-micrometer carbon monoxide (CO) laser (making it a maser, technically, but this proposal will follow the nomenclature of the previous authors). The team has chosen to propose a power beaming subsystem centered on CO lasers for three main reasons  First, the CO laser is an attractive choice in terms of minimizing environmental impact  the reasoning for this will be explained further in Section 5.1. Second, using a laser system of this type would nearly eliminate one of the largest challenges facing other laser systems  propagation efficiency. A laser beamed from the ground to an aircraft or satellite would be partially scattered and absorbed as it propagates through the densest parts of Earth s atmosphere  clouds or other weather effects would further intensify the issue. Efficiency can be maximized by careful selection of electromagnetic wavelengths that propagate most effectively through the atmosphere. Hertzberg and Sun s system, for example, is claimed 7 to obtain a 99  Phase III satellite-to-aircraft atmospheric transmission rate, although Phases I and II beaming would incur greater losses. Third, CO laser technology has been the most analyzed for the subject of power beaming for commercial aviation purposes, thanks to works by Hertzberg and Sun. Their findings have been invaluable in enabling the team to calculate and present rigorous empirical data. It should be noted that literature review and discussion with subject matter experts has indicated that a CO laser is not necessarily the optimal choice for the purpose of long-distance energy beaming, considering for example that CO lasers have developed noticeably less in terms of peak average power and size reduction than other types, such as solid state lasers, in recent years. Nevertheless, the CO laser s benefits make it a promising candidate worthy of further investigation. Another challenge faced by Phases I and II is tracking and beaming inaccuracy due to turbulence in the atmosphere. Landis and Westerlund indicate that this turbulence typically limits ground-to-satellite tracking and pointing accuracy to around 4 microradians ( rad), an unacceptably large value by at least an order of magnitude  23 . They indicate, however, that a mixture of techniques including a flexible receiving mirror to correct distortions and locating ground stations on mountaintops can significantly mitigate the issue. High-altitude observatory telescopes and ground-to-satellite laser communications systems have already demonstrated accuracies of 0.4  rad  24   with this in mind, the team predicts that sufficient accuracy to support ground-to-relay power beaming can be achieved before 2030. Phase III tracking and beaming present fewer issues. The lack of atmosphere in orbit around Earth makes space-to-space laser beaming trivial in comparison  space systems of the 1970s had already reached tracking accuracies of 0.10 to 0.01 microradians  2 . The field of satellite optics has seen incredible development since its inception, with massive increases in resolution and accuracy being accompanied by general decreases in manufacturing cost  25   26 . The team is confident that the optical developments necessary to enable a power beaming system are already well underway. The greatest challenges lie in designing flexible primary receiving mirrors that can be finely tuned to correct beam aberrations  compacting and lightening the system enough to allow for delivery and orbital insertion  making the subsystems robust enough to survive decades in space  and ensuring that satellites orbit and de-orbit in a safe manner to increase orbital capacity. Component 2023 TRL 2050 TRL Justification Power Generation  Power Grid 9 9 Much of this category relies on pre-existing technology and only requires that infrastructure be upgraded, something that will occur concurrently and independently to DEB-B s development. Laser Power and Efficiency 5 8 The present understanding of lasers such as CO lasers can be refined through the use of optics and further testing in optimization. Optics and Receivers 6 9 The advancement of optics from projects like the James Webb Space Telescope provide a basis with which to apply optical arrays for beaming and tracking from ground stations and satellites. Manufacturing 4 9 CO lasers currently have supply chain and manufacturing capability  Scalability is what is needed to ensure a suitable supply is present. Launch Capability 6 9 Current launch capabilities are expensive  costs must decrease for the laser satellites to be launched, and this will occur concurrently and independently to the development of DEB-B. Orbital Capacity 4 8 Current regulations and technology prohibit spacecraft from orbiting too closely  creating a constellation of satellites requires more work in developing anti-collision measures. Figure 4.a  Summary of technology, manufacturing, and supply chain Readiness Levels. 4.2 Supply Chain Readiness Levels The team believes that energy demands, rather than material demands, are most in need of development to support a full-coverage power beaming system by 2050. DEB-B s supply chain needs would vary from 8 phase to phase. Ground stations would see fewer up-front supply chain demands due to their relative ease of construction, but the energy demands over their operational life cycle would be higher. Relay and power satellites may be more energy-intensive to build, but would be self-sufficient once deployed. The startup cost of ground-based power beaming technology would be drastically lowered if it were able to integrate with pre-existing energy infrastructure. Based on recent federal press releases, regulation regarding renewable energy source conversion, and recent mandates from several states like California on transition to hybrid and electric vehicles in the next thirty years, sufficient infrastructure upgrades are anticipated, at least in the United States  18 . Phases II and III would require orbital insertion, presenting an additional supply chain consideration. Two major supply chain prerequisites are thus sufficient availability of launch vehicles and an overall decrease in kilogram-to-orbit costs, which is currently at around  3300 from the cheapest supplier  27 . NASA has previously cited a goal of tens of dollars per pound by the year 2050, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has claimed that Starship launches may eventually reach around  10 per kg, or around  22 per pound  28   29 . Availability of launch vehicles is not expected to be a major concern, with the number of commercial space launches growing exponentially in recent years and general access to space being greatly expanded  30 . 4.3 Manufacturing Readiness Levels The main challenges of developing a power beaming system are not technology-based  rather, it is the miniaturization of current technology, such as creating smaller lasers and higher efficiency solar cells. Hertzberg and Sun s analyses propose a fleet of 300 aircraft in the air, 400 relay satellites, and 300 power satellites  2   3 . Bekey, Meyer, and Wolfe propose 200 relay constellations, each composed of 169 mirrors, for a fleet of 2,000 aircraft  1 . Significant developments in the compactness of optical and power generating components are required to decrease production and launch costs and avoid orbital cluttering if such designs are to be implemented for the large airline fleet sizes of 2050. Current levels of satellite production from private companies such as SpaceX, which builds about 6 satellites a day, imply that Bekey, Meyer, and Wolfe s system could be manufactured in about 15 years if the production facilities were made available  31 . Former analyses placed the lifespans of the power and relay satellites at around 30 years, meaning that today s level of manufacturing is sufficient for full satellite coverage  2 , although improvements in materials science and manufacturing processes would likely lead to increased lifespans. Section 5.3 and Appendix A.2 provide further details on sizing. 4.4 Projected Timeline A preliminary timeline for the implementation of the DEB-B system is shown in Figure 4.b below. Figure 4.b  Projected timeline of technology, manufacturing, and supply chain development. 9 5 Technological Impact The introduction of a system as complex and transformative as DEB-B would likely produce impacts that reach far beyond the sphere of commercial aviation. As such, a multifaceted approach is necessary to consider and address the associated concerns and ensure that such a system could be realistically and equitably implemented. 5.1 Environmental DEB-B has the potential to greatly decarbonize air travel operations. Aviation CO2 emissions contributed around 2.4  of total global emissions in 2018  32 . While this number is relatively small, releasing emissions at higher altitudes multiplies their effects. In 2021, the US transportation sector was nearly entirely petroleum-based  33 . DEB-B would shift the energy production away from carbon-intensive fuels towards sustainable electricity generation to reduce emissions, especially those produced at altitude. Current aircraft produce about 70 to 95 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometer (pkm)  34 . The worst case for DEB-B aircraft is assumed for this analysis, that aircraft in 2050 are only equally energy efficient in aerodynamics and propulsion, and that electrical energy generation is equally carbon-intensive in 2050 as it is today. The Phase I DEB-B system, with ground stations from LAX to SEA, would reduce CO2 emissions by 15  to 37  if calculated using current California electricity generation emissions. This means that even if implemented without any other carbon neutrality objectives reached by 2050, DEB-B would have a significant positive impact on the carbon emissions produced by the aerospace industry. Even so, the Phase III system eliminates even this shortcoming as it utilizes solar power in its satellites and therefore has zero emissions from power generation. Rocket launches of power and relay satellites become the main emissions generator, reducing CO2 emissions of the entire system by over 99 ! Appendix A.5 provides calculations for this claim. Although the transition to energy-beamed propulsion signifies a massive step away from the burning of fossil fuels, the technology would not be free of environmental impact. The manufacturing of the power stations, especially the laser subsystem itself, is a significant environmental concern. As noted, there exist a variety of laser subsystems that could be used for power beaming, introducing a range of constituent materials varying in rarity, cost, and environmental impact. The CO laser chosen for this analysis is attractive in this sense, with its lasing medium being composed of relatively abundant gasses  35 . The rarest and most energy-intensive component of a CO laser is the helium that is used as a filler material. CO lasers  high efficiency also allows them to offer power savings over other types of lasers. The environmental impact of other components of the CO laser subsystem, such as the pump, optics, and structural materials can be mitigated utilizing sustainable manufacturing processes  specific analyses would need to be performed to investigate whether the large scale of the system would lead to disproportionately large environmental impacts during the manufacturing and construction stages. As previously noted, the team s choice to investigate CO lasers as opposed to other types of lasers was motivated partially by the CO laser s inability to ionize the atmospheric air that it propagates through, which is a potential environmental concern facing other types of lasers. Supporting calculations are shown in Appendix A.4. Furthemore, a maser, compared to a visible light laser, would have less likelihood of disrupting the view of the night sky. Depending on their location, size, and mode of operation, ground stations could have considerable impact on their immediate surroundings. One or multiple ground stations could be placed at participating airports if their presence is deemed safe and sufficient space is allocated. Intermediary ground stations, however, would be most effectively placed at high altitudes and far from densely populated areas. Besides the potential habitat destruction and disruption during their construction, the operation of the ground stations also presents the possibility of more long-term ecosystem disruption in their immediate vicinities, similar to the localized effects that have been researched around solar farms and nuclear power plants  36   37 . These effects could be mitigated by careful selection and responsible operation of ground station locations. Overall impact is also limited in the sense that, as noted in Section 3.4, it is expected that only a relatively small number of ground stations will be constructed overall. 10 Space-based stations would need to include more energy-intensive structural elements. They would also require solar cells, likely composed of a gallium arsenide derivative as is common in space applications. Each of these subsystems carries with it the environmental impact necessary to source, refine, and integrate its components. 5.2 Industrial Whether of its own volition or under regulatory pressure, the aviation industry will be required to adapt to advancements in energy technology. General aircraft manufacturing procedures would need to be altered to account for the new propulsion subsystem, be it photovoltaic cells and propellers or receiving dishes and laser turbofans. Airports, fortunately, would not need to alter much of their operational structure to accommodate changes in aircraft. One of the largest changes would involve the manufacturing, operation, and maintenance of power stations over popular routes of aircraft travel. Pilots and air traffic controllers would need to be trained to operate safely with the new power beaming infrastructure. During Phase I, it may be warranted or even required to fly aircraft at lower altitudes to avoid propagation losses or cloud cover  noise and efficiency analyses would need to be performed. Changes in air traffic routes might also be implemented to accommodate ground station placement. These changes would likely be small in scale given the limited scale of Phase I. Aircraft powered by Phases II and III might benefit from flying higher than modern aircraft due to reduction of drag and beaming efficiency losses. DEB-B s implementation would likely require cooperation between government agencies and the private aviation industry on a scale not yet seen. This is due to both the large capital investment required and the necessity for regulation on a public level for safety, security, and sociopolitical reasons. This cooperation might take on a form similar to NASA and Boeing s recent Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project, with private industry and public entities working together to research and deploy the DEB-B system  38 . In the long term, DEB-B s potential to provide power to a diverse range of commercial, private, and military aircraft, both piloted and unpiloted, may usher in design changes across other fields of the aerospace industry as companies and agencies work to integrate this transformative energy source. 5.3 Financial The largest financial hurdle to implementing DEB-B is the capital cost of manufacturing and launching space-based power stations and relays. Various methods of organization for the financial operation of the system can be imagined  for the purposes of this report, the team proposes a system similar to that described by power beaming pioneer Leik Myrabo, in which  laser (or microwave) energy  is  sold by satellite power station consortiums to the  aerospace  industry on a contract basis.   22  The team recommends that one or more non-airline companies build and sell power from these satellites as a service. The cost to build and launch each satellite is estimated to be  11.2 million at most. See Appendix A.2 for calculation details. Given 30 years of development and manufacturing at scale as shown in the development timeline above, this price point is feasible to achieve. The companies owning the satellite infrastructure can also sell their service to power rural energy networks, other satellites, emergency services, and potentially off-world mining companies for a greater return on investment. Hertzberg et al. provide another excellent, albeit dated, cost analysis  3   decreases in manufacturing and launch costs would need to be considered in a contemporary analysis. 5.4 Social and Political A significant challenge to implementing orbiting power beaming stations would be political and social backlash. On the political side is a history of superpowers clashing over the use of laser weapons in space  39   on the social side is the perception of lasers as deadly weapons in science fiction and pop culture. DEB-B s deployment would likely be preceded by international agreements banning the use of laser weaponry in space  without them, the satellites would be viewed as military targets. Such agreements could build upon pre-existing protocols for the use of lasers, but much more diplomatic work remains to ensure safe operation  40   41 . Even if private ownership is found to be more efficient or cost-effective, satellites may need to be operated or regulated by public entities, perhaps even as an international 11 collaboration to address security concerns. In addition, current regulation of satellite orbits and de-orbiting create a regulatory hurdle, as the sheer number of satellites required to keep DEB-B operational would constitute risking satellite collision and debris. Care must be taken to ensure safety in the satellite design to satisfy current and future regulations. Social and political acceptance of DEB-B could be aided by its potential application for non-aviation purposes such as emergency power beaming to places affected by natural disasters  only a shipping crate with a large photovoltaic receiver would need to be shipped to the affected area. Beyond 2050, space-based power beaming might make up a significant portion of the energy infrastructure of terrestrial and even lunar society. 6 Documentation of Research Development and Changes As requested in the competition guidelines, the following section documents the changes between the initial proposal, submitted on February 28th, 2023, and this final research paper.

High on Hydrogen! (Manhattan College),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2023 - ""Clean Aviation Energy""",,"Abstract For the 2023 NASA Gateway to Blue Skies Competition, the team from Manhattan College has elected to research the viability of hydrogen Fuel to power the commercial aviation industry in the future. Moving forward, it is our belief that hydrogen fuel has the ideal combination of properties ranging from energy density, to tremendous availability, to pollution-free use, for replacing jet fuel as the source of energy for the next generation of passenger aircraft. This document will discuss the creation, storage, transportation, process of loading hydrogen into commercial aircraft, climate impacts, safety, and readiness levels. Our research has revealed that in terms of generation, a combination of blue hydrogen and green hydrogen, via biomass gasification and hydrogen electrolysis, respectively, is the best answer to meeting the demand for hydrogen fuel in the near future. Looking forward, layered double hydroxide coatings on electrolyzer electrodes hold the key to unlocking hydrogen production in an entirely green fashion, using seawater as the main resource to fuel aircraft in coastal states  airports. Meanwhile, the landlocked middle states can rely on biomass gasification to provide their hydrogen fuel, as they produce much of America s crop and vegetation waste. Gasification will be performed in conjunction with carbon capture technology, to repurpose the carbon dioxide byproduct to aid the photosynthesis process of future crops. The next logical steps for the adoption of hydrogen as an alternative fuel are its storage and transportation. There are many methods of possible storage for hydrogen  these include in a gaseous form or a liquid form, which have the obstacles of needing to be stored at extremely high pressure and cryogenic temperature, respectively. However, the most promising method of storage for gaseous hydrogen is bonding hydrogen to a liquid organic hydrogen carrier, which results in an oil-like compound that can safely be kept at atmospheric conditions. These obstacles pose a problem for transportation, especially with regard to methods commonly used today to transport gasoline and other modern fuels. It is our belief, however, that a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including autonomous vehicles, eVTOLs, and hyperloops is the future of hydrogen fuel transportation between production facilities and airports. Once the hydrogen fuel arrives at the airport, it can be used to power planes in one of two methods, either powering electric motors with a hydrogen fuel cell or used in a combustion process, similar to modern-day jet fuel turbines. We propose using gaseous hydrogen for shorter flights (less than two hours) and liquid hydrogen for longer flights (more than two hours) to benefit from the positive aspects of each phase of the fuel. Research into the safety of hydrogen fuel proved that hydrogen s low atomic weight, penchant for quick dispersion, and need for high concentration to achieve combustion means that hydrogen is relatively safe to use as a fuel source when compared to natural gas and gasoline. Finally, much of the environmental impacts of hydrogen fuel come during its production. However, with the proper carbon capture technology and usage of the stored carbon gasses in processes such as fermentation or use in the photosynthesis of crops, much of the pollution can be mitigated. Looking towards the future, green hydrogen production and the use of hydrogen fuel cells in aircraft lend to the belief that the coming decades will see water as the only byproduct of hydrogen fuel adoption.  1. Generation  The first step toward shifting the future of the aviation industry toward being fueled by hydrogen is the generation of an ample supply of fuel to power all commercial flights. Luckily, hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and can be sourced from the earth s natural resources, namely water and vegetation material through different techniques. Water covers roughly 70  of the Earth s surface, making it an ideal source of fuel due to its vast abundance and renewable nature. Vegetation material is also renewable and abundant, as each year harvests for food production provide ample waste material. The production of hydrogen fuel is categorized into three color-based groups  gray, blue, and green hydrogen  1 . The vast majority of today's hydrogen gas is produced as gray hydrogen, which involves the use of industrial processes powered by the burning of fossil fuels that are directly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution  1 . Thus, it is believed that gray hydrogen production contributes 830 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution each year, according to the International Energy Agency  2 . To meet the need to reduce carbon emissions, some companies have begun producing blue hydrogen. Blue hydrogen production retains much of the industrial polluting practices associated with the aforementioned gray hydrogen but also features the addition of steps to capture the carbon emissions before they are released into the atmosphere  1 . The captured carbon emissions are stored underground or within large hills and mountain ranges  1 . However, this is a costly process and stores more carbon-based gasses than the world can consume in industry. However, as carbon capture and storage technology are further advanced, it is theorized that blue hydrogen will become a cost-effective intermediate step in clean hydrogen production due to its ability to be retrofitted onto existing gray hydrogen facilities  1 . Finally, green hydrogen involves the use of a renewable, clean energy source to power a process that produces zero carbon emissions  1 . Green hydrogen can be produced using sources such as solar and wind power, in addition to nuclear power  1, 3 . Unfortunately, in the current energy landscape, roughly 95  of the world s hydrogen is produced using gray methods, and just under one percent of all hydrogen produced can be considered green hydrogen  1, 3 . In order to eventually produce exclusively clean fuel by the time hydrogen is adopted into use in commercial aviation, it is necessary to improve the ratio of more environmentally conscious green hydrogen to gray hydrogen through time. In terms of environmental  greenness,  the most promising currently available process for the production of hydrogen fuel is hydrogen electrolysis. This entails the separation of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas by applying electrical current through it  4, 5 . The pure oxygen captured as a byproduct of electrolysis can be used for medical devices such as oxygen tanks used at hospitals  6 . Hydrogen electrolysis has the potential to be performed in an entirely green fashion, even on a large scale. This is evidenced by the use of clean, renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, to power the electrolysis process  1 . Notably, these processes are already in use in places such as the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field in Japan, the largest green hydrogen plant of its kind in the world  7 . Three major types of electrolyzers currently exist  alkaline, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), and solid oxide  4, 5 . Alkaline electrolysis is the simplest of the three and is defined by its use of a liquid electrolyte medium in which the electrodes are placed  4, 5 . When electric current is applied, hydroxide ions are sent from one electrode to the other, and a diaphragm with a small pore size separates the desired gas products  4, 5 . PEM is a more expensive form of electrolysis due to its use of a specialized polymer membrane, engineered specifically to facilitate the separation of hydrogen and oxygen gasses, by allowing exclusively hydrogen ions to pass through it  4, 5 . PEM electrolyzers also use a solid electrolyte and are currently the industry leader in terms of efficiency and production  4, 5 . Finally, solid oxide electrolysis is currently the rarest of the three and is still a young developing technology. However, solid oxide electrolyzers provide the potential upside of beginning the electrolysis process with steam instead of liquid water, circumventing the need for the phase change to occur before the hydrogen and oxygen gasses are separated, thereby reducing the amount of energy required to form the gas products  4, 5 . 3 A major concern with the process of hydrogen electrolysis is its use of highly purified water which can present a potential problem with the world s fresh drinking water supply  8 . While other, less pure forms of water can currently be used to perform hydrogen electrolysis, they often contribute to accelerated deterioration of the electrolyzer s components. The major problem faced using impure water is deposits of insoluble materials, which build up on the surface of electrodes and reduce the electrolyzer s efficiency. To remedy this problem, researchers at several universities, like Stanford and Houston, have been investigating ways to develop a coating for the electrodes, where the majority of oxidation and damage occur, to allow for the use of sea saltwater in electrolyzers  8, 9 . This type of coating is referred to as layered double hydroxides (LDH)  8, 9 . LDHs are mineral-based coatings that, when combined with transition metals, can be applied to the surface of an electrolyzer s electrodes to protect them against corrosion when they are exposed to alkaline environments such as seawater  8, 9 . They also have the benefit of improving the chain of chemical reactions occurring in an electrolyzer to undergo the more desirable oxygen evolution reaction, rather than the unintentional chlorine evolution reaction  8, 9 . This results in hydrogen gas with oxygen rather than a chlorine byproduct. As LDH coatings help unlock seawater s potential in hydrogen production, the hope is that airports in coastal cities in particular can obtain their hydrogen fuel directly from the sea without the need for large irrigation or infrastructure projects to be carried out. In summation, the ability to use seawater for electrolysis will eliminate one of electrolysis s most hindering obstacles, its need for purified water. By removing the burden that large-scale electrolysis in its current state would place on the world s freshwater supply, the industry will be propelled forward, gaining substantial traction for further funding and research as a potential fuel source to replace fossil fuels, including jet fuel. Electrolysis, however, is not the only process that produces hydrogen fuel. Namely, biomass gasification is a thermochemical reaction process that produces hydrogen gas from biological scrap from harvested crops by heating them at low pressure to just below the point of combustion, at which point hydrogen and syngas (a combination of methane, carbon dioxide,   carbon monoxide) are released in a gaseous form  10, 11 . Unfortunately, without the proper equipment and storage for the capture and storage of carbon emissions, this process falls into the gray hydrogen production category, due to its industrial processes having byproducts including the pollutants carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide  3 . By heating but not combusting the organic materials, the emission of harmful carbon gasses is reduced but is not totally eliminated  10, 11 . Moving forward, to meet the rising demand for hydrogen fuel, new and existing biomass gasification plants should be equipped with carbon-capturing machinery to reduce the process s harmful greenhouse gas impact  1 . Carbon capture is a process that involves various methods, both biological and artificial, to trap carbon emissions before they escape into the atmosphere  12 . An example of biological carbon capture are carbon sinks, which use natural vegetation habitats to absorb carbon dioxide, and an example of artificial carbon capture can be seen in the emerging technology known as ionic liquids, which are fluids that have had their molecular structure altered to absorb carbon dioxide  12 . To supplement the supply of hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of seawater, we hypothesize that a cost-effective solution in the continental United States   middle states  may be to use biomass gasification rather than transporting massive amounts of seawater hundreds or even thousands of miles to carry out hydrogen production by way of electrolysis. Since a large portion of the US s crops are cultivated in the Midwest, it seems natural to use the available biological waste resources to produce hydrogen fuel for airports in that region. Ideally, as previously mentioned carbon capturing technology similar to blue hydrogen production will be used, but rather than storing the carbon dioxide, it will be applied to subsequent batches of crops to aid the photosynthesis process. Much of the carbon dioxide emissions that are captured will be stored briefly, and then transported to local farms, from which the crops originated. This carbon dioxide can then be applied to new crop growths via pipe systems within large greenhouse structures, similar to modern-day watering systems. In this way, many of the adverse tradeoffs of employing blue hydrogen production to fuel landlocked airports can be offset. Hydrogen gas can be used in either a liquid or a gaseous form. The aforementioned processes yield hydrogen fuel in its gaseous state. Liquefaction is a process that can turn gaseous hydrogen into a liquid, by way of cooling the hydrogen and passing it through a series of specialized valves, until it yields 4 a liquid fuel product that can then be stored in insulated cryogenic tanks  13,14 . Liquefaction has the unfortunate effect of reducing the energy content of the hydrogen fuel by about 30 , and it also brings tremendous cost due to the specialized machinery and abundance of energy required to carry out the process  14 . The current state of technology for the generation of hydrogen gas as a fuel source is a promising sign for its future in aeronautics. Table 1 shows a projection of the amount of hydrogen fuel that needs to be produced in order to keep up with the global demand for aviation fuel based on an average annual fuel consumption from the years 2005-2021. Both liquid and gaseous hydrogen were both analyzed individually for future production scaling based on the assumption that they will each be solely replacing jet fuel. Based on past trends, the demand will presumably increase with time and further production scaling projections must be completed. In terms of methods of fuel production, hydrogen has proven to be a very favorable option to replace traditional jet fuel. The abundance of water and crop waste on Earth provides reliable, renewable energy for a theoretically indefinite period of time. Research being done by leading universities to improve the efficiency and productivity of electrolysis technology also provides tremendous hope for the future of hydrogen as a fuel source looking forward to the 2050s. Table 1  Projected Hydrogen Fuel Demand Based on Energy Density Compared to Modern-day Demand of Jet Fuel  13, 15, 16, 17  Fuel Density (kg L) Energy Density (MJ L) Annual Consumption (L   kg) Jet Fuel 0.84 kg L 40.320 MJ L 2.814 1011 L  2.364 1011 kg Gaseous Hydrogen 0.0012 kg L 0.144 MJ L 7.88 1013 L  9.46 1010 kg Liquid Hydrogen 0.07 kg L 8.000 MJ L 1.42 1012 L  9.94 1010 kg 2. Storage The hydrogen needs to be safely stored before it can be transported to the airport to be used on aircraft. Hydrogen is generated in its gaseous phase, and it needs to be stored in an energy efficient as well as cost-effective method in order to ensure its maximum utilization. This plays a vital role in the transportation stage as well as in storing the hydrogen before it is loaded into the aircraft. The two common methods used to store hydrogen are storing gaseous hydrogen and liquid hydrogen. Storing hydrogen regardless of its form is a challenging process due to the extremely low boiling point of liquid hydrogen that requires cryogenic tanks or with a very low density of gaseous hydrogen where using the high-pressure tanks is vital. In addition, hydrogen has low density where 1 kg of hydrogen gas requires a volume of 11 m3 at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure  18 . By compressing the gaseous hydrogen or by decreasing the temperature of the liquid hydrogen below the hydrogen s critical temperature, hydrogen can be contained and stored  18 . 2.1 Gaseous Hydrogen   LOHCs Hydrogen stored in the gaseous phase is known as gaseous hydrogen. It is stored by containing hydrogen gas in very high-pressure tanks in order to achieve a higher storage density  19 . Although this ensures the maximum storage possible, maintaining these tanks at such high pressures is a very expensive process. Hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy density (8 MJ L) as compared to that of gasoline (32 MJ L)  20 . This accounts for the large space necessary for hydrogen storage using this method. In addition, gaseous hydrogen is also odorless which makes it difficult to detect any leakage through the tanks. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), an alternative way of storing hydrogen, have been researched since the 1980s  21 . These are organic compounds that exist as liquids or low melting point solids under ambient storage conditions. Using this system to store hydrogen is potentially safe and requires relatively cheap storage materials  21 . Since LOHC is an oil-like medium, it can be stored and transported under normal conditions similar to transporting gasoline  22 . This can cut down storage expenses significantly by eliminating the need for high-pressure tanks needed for the storage of gaseous hydrogen. One m  LOHC enables the safe storage of 57 kg of hydrogen  22 . When compared to storing hydrogen as gaseous hydrogen, using LOHCs is the best choice given the elimination of extensive capital 5 and energy requirements involved in the former method. The concept of storing hydrogen using LOHC is based on reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation cycles. In the LOHC hydrogenation reaction, hydrogen is chemically bound to the LOHC at high temperatures and high pressures  23 . This reaction is achieved with the help of a specifically designed catalyst. This is an exothermic process and generates around 10 kWh kg of H2 at 200-250    24 . The heat generated can be stored and used later in the endothermic dehydrogenation process or for other uses within the facilities to increase the overall efficiency of the system. The hydrogenated LOHC  can be transported and used through the existing infrastructures used for gasoline and diesel  22 . When the hydrogen gas needs to be extracted, the LOHC  is passed through a dehydrogenation reactor in which, hydrogen is released in its pure form through the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction taking place at high temperature and at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure  23 . This is an endothermic process and requires around 11 kWh kg of H2 at 250-300    24 . Once the hydrogen is extracted, the unloaded LOHC- can be transported back to the hydrogen generation site, where it can be hydrogenated again to repeat the process as shown in Figure 1. This enables the LOHC medium to be reused several hundred times  25 . Figure 1  The Hydrogen Manufacturing to Utilization Cycle One way to maximize the usage of the energy released through the exothermic hydrogenation process is by using it in the electrolysis process to generate hydrogen gas for coastal facilities. The production of 1 kg of hydrogen from water requires around 39 kWh of electricity  26 . However, this value may change depending on the efficiency of the electrolysis system. Some of this electricity can be sourced from the thermal energy generated by hydrogenation. This can be achieved by using thermoelectric generators that can convert thermal energy into electrical energy  27 . One of the important factors in the electrolysis process is the temperature at which the reaction occurs. As the temperature of the system increases, the efficiency also increases  28 . Thermochemical water-splitting processes use high-temperature heat (500  2,000 C) to drive a series of chemical reactions that produce hydrogen  29 . Using the heat energy released during the hydrogenation process to provide heat for the electrolysis process can ensure the optimal use of the produced heat. This increases the efficiency of the entire process. Since hydrogen generation through electrolysis and the LOHC hydrogenation happens at the same coastal facility, this can be achieved as the energy does not require to be stored and transported over long distances. Another way to use the generated energy is by using the excess heat for other domestic uses in the facility like a water heating system, or even using it in winter for heating purposes if the facility is located where it experiences a cold climate. Thermal stores can be used for this purpose. These are water tanks that are insulated and have the ability to store heat as hot water for several hours  30 . These tanks can vary in size from around 250 liters to 500 liters or more and can provide hot water to the facility. These should be used the same day to ensure no energy loss. 6 Heat batteries can be used to store energy. In these batteries, heat can be stored in materials known as phase change materials (PCM). The heat is stored in the batteries when this material changes phase from a solid to a liquid. The spare heat or electricity can be used to charge the PCM within the battery. The phase change material changes back into a solid with a release of heat when heat energy is needed  30 . This method of energy storage can be a viable option for using the generated heat in the LOHC dehydrogenation facility by transporting these heat batteries from the hydrogenation facility. Although heat batteries are currently used by installing them in the facility, and using them to store energy, it can be anticipated that technologies that can enable the transportation of these heat batteries will be developed by the 2050s. This will enable the optimal storage of heat released from hydrogenation that can be transported to the dehydrogenation facility at a different location. Researchers are also studying the hot pressure swing reactor to improve the efficiency of the LOHC system by using the heat generated from hydrogenation directly for the dehydrogenation process. In this process, the required heat for the dehydrogenation of hydrogen-rich LOHC compound can be provided from the previous hydrogenation process that occurred in the same reactor before. However, this requires the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation to take place in the same hot reactor and the hydrogenation to be carried out at a slightly higher temperature than dehydrogenation. This allows the storage of hydrogenation heat in a suitable heat storage system for its reuse in subsequent dehydrogenation  31 . Hydrogenation occurs at low temperatures and high pressure while dehydrogenation occurs at high temperatures and low pressure. In this reactor, the reactor pressure is kept constant by continuous dosing of hydrogen. The heat released by the exothermic hydrogenation reaction leads to a temperature increase and the reactor is switched from hydrogenation to dehydrogenation mode by pressure adjustment at the back pressure regulator  31 . This is a potential option for using the heat generated from hydrogenation directly in the dehydrogenation process given that both reactions occur at the same facility. 2.2 Liquid Hydrogen When hydrogen is stored in the liquid phase, it is known as liquid hydrogen. Using liquid hydrogen can be a viable alternative to power most of the aircraft for more than 2 hours even though it can result in energy loss through the liquefaction process. Hydrogen has a very low boiling point of -253 C ( 423 F). Therefore, in order to liquefy hydrogen gas, it needs to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures below its boiling temperature to store it in a safe manner and prevent it from boiling  32 . After the liquefaction process, liquid hydrogen can be stored in cryogenic tanks. However, storing hydrogen as liquid comes with several challenges. An extensive amount of energy is required in the liquefaction process and to maintain the cryogenic tanks at very low temperatures. Apart from that, more than 30  of hydrogen s energy content is consumed during the liquefaction process resulting in a loss of energy  32 . Furthermore, great care is to be provided while transporting liquid hydrogen to maintain it below its boiling point to prevent any boil-offs, that is liquid vaporization. In a liquid hydrogen storage system, around 0.3   3  of the hydrogen is lost due to boil-off  23 . Using insulated cryogenic containers is an efficient way to prevent boil-offs. This is done by having a double wall construction and by evacuating the space between the walls to nearly eliminate heat transfer from convection and conduction. Most liquid hydrogen tanks are spherical in shape in order to provide the lowest surface area for heat transfer per unit volume. A large tank will have a proportionally less heat transfer area when compared to a small tank. This is because the volume increases faster than the surface area when the diameter of the tank increases. This way, the rate of boil-off can be reduced which reduces  33 . 3. Transportation Hydrogen imposes a challenge on our current infrastructure. Compared to other types of energy, like electricity, which is readily available, transporting hydrogen creates a greater cost. There are several methods for transporting hydrogen, including transferring it in gaseous form, in liquid form, and using LOHCs. Gaseous hydrogen can be transported in pressurized tanks, or it can be transported through existing pipeline infrastructure by mixing hydrogen and natural gas  34 . Liquid hydrogen can be transported using insulated cryogenic pipelines or special cryogenic tanks. However, transporting the 7 cryogenic tanks imposes a safety concern because liquid hydrogen is highly explosive, and having it on a moving truck around traffic creates concern  35 . To benefit from LOHCs, for coastal regions, the hydrogen produced at a manufacturing facility is hydrogenated into LOHC  and put into tanks similar to the ones used for gasoline and diesel. The tanks can be transported in various methods depending on the location of the manufacturing facility, the LOHC extraction facility, and the location of the airport. These include electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs), fully-autonomous or electric trucks, and underground hyperloop tunnels. EVTOLs have been a developing technology for years that hopefully will be in widespread use in the future. Beta Technologies, a company based in Vermont, is working on eVTOLs that can carry up to six passengers or a total cargo weight of 1,500 lbs with a range of around 289 miles  36, 37 . Beta Technologies is also working on a charging network called the beta charge cube that would effortlessly provide power to electric vehicles, eVTOLs, and electric aircrafts. They plan to have a network of 150 charge cubes by 2025  37 . These technological advances of eVTOLs propose a solution for LOHC  tanks to be transported to different coastal regions. Another method of transporting hydrogen is by using autonomous or electric Trucks. These trucks will provide coastal transportation to the dehydrogenation facility located near the airport. The trucks can also be used to transport heat batteries, which are used to store energy during the hydrogenation process. Considering the weight of the battery, using trucks can be a better option compared to eVTOLs. Waymo is a company based in California also previously recognized as Google s Self-Driving project  38 . Their service called Waymo One provides electric autonomous car rides in Phoenix, Arizona, and some rides in San Francisco, California.  39  They are also working on bringing rides to Los Angeles, California. Waymo is also working on autonomous trucks that can be used to transport cargo. Currently, Waymo Via is a name given to Waymo s autonomous truck network.  40  These trucks are being tested by the company for autonomous use and transportation of cargo. Waymo Via is also partnered with Uber Freight to work on advancing and scaling the use of autonomous trucks  41 . Another company working on electric trucks is Tesla, based in Austin, Texas  42 . Their semi truck is fully electric with integrated safety and advanced technology. This truck uses 2kWh per mile and has a range of up to 500 miles. This truck is already on the road, with PepsiCo receiving their first big shipment from Tesla  43 . For airports located in non-coastal regions, biomass gasification will be used to generate hydrogen until the infrastructure is available for hyperloop technology to transfer green hydrogen from coastal area to these regions. Depending on the location of the biomass gasification plant, similar transportation methods to coastal regions will be used. The high-pressurized gaseous hydrogen tanks will be transported using eVTOLS and fully-autonomous or electric trucks. When the infrastructure is available for underground hyperloops, then LOHC  tanks from coastal manufacturing facilities will be transported to extraction facilities in non-coastal regions for airport use. Hyperloops allow for a safer and faster transport of hydrogen compared to trucks, especially over long distances  44 . Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, a company based in California, proposes to bring the hyperloop concept into reality  37 . Hyperloop is a proposed concept of a capsule inside vacuum-sealed tubes powered by magnetic tracks and a small electric current  45 . The concept proposes the pod to reach up to 760 mph  45, ,46, 47 . There are many other companies working on this concept, such as Virgin Hyperloop, also known as Hyperloop One  48, 49, 50 . Once LOHC  tanks are transported, a facility located near the airport will extract the gaseous hydrogen and fill it into high-pressure tanks to be used for short-range flights or convert it to liquid hydrogen and store it in cryogenic tanks in a liquefaction facility, which is anticipated to be at the same location as dehydrogenation facility to be used for long-range flights. Depending on the location of the LOHC extraction facility and its distance from the airport, hydrogen tanks can be either stored in the facility or transported to the airport storage facility. When needed, personnel stationed at the aircraft will place an order for the autonomous vehicles to transport the hydrogen tanks from the airport storage facility directly to the aircraft for use by the fuel cells. The transportation process of hydrogen can be best visualized in Figure 2. 8 Figure 2  Hydrogen Transportation Process Universal Hydrogen, a company based in California, proposes this concept of directly putting hydrogen tanks into the aircraft. In their model, gaseous hydrogen tanks are transported in modular capsules and put directly into the aircraft  51 . Rod Williams, chief commercial officer at Universal Hydrogen said,  The modules are loaded onto the aircraft, they're latched down, and then they basically serve as the fuel tank within the aircraft to supply the fuel to the powertrain   52 . When all the hydrogen is consumed, empty tanks are taken back to the facility to be refilled and swapped with full tanks. This whole process saves fueling time significantly. Big companies like JetBlue, American Airlines, and Airbus have already invested in Universal Hydrogen  51 . 4. Into the Aircraft The application of hydrogen in aircraft is the next step that needs to be considered. As using hydrogen in aircraft is still in the development process, there are many challenges that the new generation of engineers needs to face and carry on, such as ways to use hydrogen to power the aircraft, and store the hydrogen on the airplane. Even though using hydrogen in aircraft is still in the early stage, some aviation industries have already tried using hydrogen to replace current aircraft fuel. Two main ways proposed to power the aircraft with hydrogen as a fuel are combustion and using a fuel cell  53 . For the former proposed method, the process is similar to the traditional internal combustion engines, except hydrogen is used in place of the fossil fuel counterpart  54 . Although using a combustion engine is an almost carbon-free process, it releases other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, or NOx  55 . NOx is an atmospheric pollutant that could cause poor air quality, create brown-orange haze, and is generated through the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures and pressures within the engine s combustion chamber  56 . Hence, hydrogen engines often require an exhaust treatment system to reduce NOx emissions  54 . On the other hand, using a fuel cell produces no emissions except water vapor  It converts the chemical potential energy of a hydrogen molecule into electrical energy and creates water and heat as by-products in the case of using green hydrogen  57 . Furthermore, a fuel cell is more efficient than a combustion engine, as a fuel cell can convert hydrogen into electricity at an efficiency rate of up to 60  while a combustion engine can only generate electricity with an efficiency rate of 33 -35   58 . Additionally, a fuel cell has superior durability due to its simple design, which features fewer moving parts, and its need for minimal maintenance. This results in a high level of reliability and is less prone to mechanical failures compared to a combustion engine  59 . Overall, a fuel cell is often considered a better choice than a combustion engine due to its great advantages in many applications. Although using a fuel cell is promising to achieve carbon-free emission, storing hydrogen on an airplane introduces some challenges. Hydrogen is very light compared to traditional aviation fuel but has three times higher specific energy as compared to traditional aviation fuel. On the other hand, the volumetric energy of hydrogen is much lower in the way that four times the volume of hydrogen is needed to produce the same thrust in an airplane, which consequently makes it harder to store hydrogen in an aircraft  60 . To address this problem, in the design of future airplanes, more space must be assigned to hydrogen tanks for instance by using blended wings or replacing a part of the fuselage space with hydrogen fuel tank storage, which requires giving up approximately 9 rows of economy class seats towards the back of the cabin. This would require airlines to increase the number of flights to maintain their existing passenger flow, which could lead to air traffic congestion. On the other hand, the use of liquid hydrogen significantly reduces the required fuel tank space by 80  to deliver the same amount of energy compared to gaseous hydrogen 61 . Also, the volume ratio of liquid to gas is approximately about 1 848 62 , making liquid hydrogen more feasible for commercial aircraft to travel long distances than gaseous hydrogen. In addition, the companies Hypoint and GTL are collaborating on the development of an ultra-lightweight cryogenic tank that can store liquid hydrogen in aircraft with dimensions of only 2.4 meters in length and 1.2 meters in diameter 63 . This is approximately equivalent to the space required for about three rows of economy-class seats towards the back of the cabin, providing significant space savings compared to gaseous hydrogen tanks. However, as previously mentioned earlier, about 30  of the energy contained in hydrogen is lost during the process of liquefaction, which also involves significant 9 costs due to the specialized machinery required for the process and the large amount of energy needed to carry out the process. The amount of hydrogen fuel required to power the aircraft for about two hours depends on the model of the airplane and its consumption rate. For example, A Boeing 737 typically consumes around 13,627 liters of jet fuel per hour  64 . Given that liquid hydrogen requires four times the volume of jet fuel, an estimated 54,508 liters of liquid hydrogen would be needed to power the aircraft for every hour of flight. Furthermore, the liquid hydrogen has to be stored at the temperature of -252.9  C for twelve hours or more, and this means that the development of onboard cryogenic systems is needed as the airliner s cryogenic pumps have to serve 10000-hour working lifetimes 61 .On the other hand, gaseous hydrogen has a lower density compared to liquid hydrogen, as shown in Table 1. Expanding on from the previous example, using gaseous hydrogen as aviation fuel for Boeing 737 requires even a larger volume of tank to store it in the aircraft. Based on the earlier mentioned volume ratio of liquid to gas, approximately about 4.6 liters of gaseous hydrogen would be required per   10 hour of flight to power 7 the aircraft without compression. However, gaseous hydrogen has an advantage over liquid hydrogen in that it does not incur energy losses of 30 , and its storage requirements are relatively simple since gaseous hydrogen does not require cryogenic temperatures like liquid hydrogen, which makes its storage and handling less complex and less expensive. To benefit from the positive aspects of gaseous hydrogen, we believe that gaseous hydrogen is a viable option for short-range flights, as the large fuel tank required for longer flights may not be feasible given the limited space in an aircraft. On the other hand, liquid hydrogen is a more suitable option for long-range flights due to its higher energy density and significantly reduced fuel tank space requirements. 5. Climate Impacts and Safety As with any aspect of engineering research, safety is a crucial topic of focus. In order for hydrogen to be considered, its viability in regard to overall safety compared to other traditional fuels such as gasoline or natural gas needs to be assured as well as its overall effect on the environment. Research on the properties of hydrogen and its behavior in certain environments proves that hydrogen is a safer alternative fuel. While it is still a flammable substance and should still be handled with the appropriate care, hydrogen possesses some qualities that make it safer to use. Furthermore, by using hydrogen to fuel future aircrafts, the carbon footprint created is significantly reduced. The first important aspect of hydrogen is its density  at 1.2 kg m3, it is the lightest known substance in the universe, roughly 14 times lighter than air  65 . As a result, hydrogen disperses very rapidly, which would minimize the risk in the case of a leak. In order for hydrogen gas to pose the risk of catching fire, it must be concentrated very highly, must have a certain amount of oxidizer present, and the mixture must reach a high enough temperature  65 . Even if hydrogen was present in low concentrations, less than 10 , the ignition energy required to ignite it would be much greater than that of gasoline and natural gas  66 . Furthermore, much lower concentrations of gasoline and natural gas when compared to hydrogen are required to pose a risk of explosion. The concentration range for which hydrogen can be explosive is 18.3-59 , but when compared to the same range for gasoline and natural gas, which is 1.1-3.3 , it is clear that hydrogen is much safer in this regard  66 . Liquid hydrogen in particular has safety factors that should be considered. Like gaseous hydrogen, it is still colorless and odorless and it also retains a low density meaning it will still rise above in most mediums. One difference that could be a concern to address is its temperature and boiling point. Liquid hydrogen must be kept at extremely low temperatures to avoid phase change into a gas. This is especially important since hydrogen also possesses one of the lowest boiling points of any gas, meaning evaporation could occur if the conditions for keeping the hydrogen cold are not sufficient  67 . One thing relevant to liquid hydrogen is the presence of ortho-hydrogen and para-hydrogen. These terms are collectively known as spin isomers of hydrogen and refer to the direction of the protons in a hydrogen molecule spin. Ortho-hydrogen molecules spin in the same direction while para-hydrogen molecules spin in opposite directions. Additionally, para-hydrogen exists at a lower energy state than ortho-hydrogen. As a result, keeping liquid hydrogen at the required temperature can result in the ortho converting to para-hydrogen, a process that typically releases heat and makes evaporation more likely. 10 This  boil-off  gas that results can cause burns to the skin if not handled properly and can cause typically reliable materials such as carbon steel, plastic, or rubber to become brittle and thus more prone to failure  67 . The fact that hydrogen gas is colorless, odorless, and tasteless may seem like it would be very dangerous in the event of a leak, as it would be undetectable, especially as its properties would cause it to rise  66 . However, this problem has been mitigated by developing hydrogen sensors, which help detect leaks. This is especially beneficial compared to the process used for gasoline and natural gas. Mercaptan, an odorant that contains sulfur, is added to these fuels in order to make them detectable. Odorants such as this are known to contaminate fuel cells  66 . Therefore, hydrogen can be optimal in the case of powering fuel cells. It is important to note that although hydrogen may possess some benefits to safety, it should still be treated like any other flammable gas. This means taking measures to ensure that in the event of a leak, hydrogen is not able to form in large concentrations and cannot reach a temperature where it is capable of igniting. There are those who would be skeptical of the safety of hydrogen, especially when looking at disasters such as Hindenburg in 1937. In the aftermath of this tragedy, hydrogen, which was used to keep the airship afloat, was blamed for causing the fire that ultimately resulted in the destruction of the Hindenburg. However, it was found later that the airship s outer covering was coated with a reactive chemical, whose properties made it more closely resemble rocket fuel  66 . It is events like this that give hydrogen a bad reputation but with the right preventative measures, hydrogen can be successfully utilized as an alternative fuel with its safety benefits making it the more appealing choice over gasoline and natural gas. Hydrogen fuel would greatly work to offset the effects of carbon emissions. However, it is unlikely that it can be completely eliminated. For this reason, how to make captured carbon emissions a benefit is a growing topic of interest. One benefit is using carbon as fuel in the making of consumer goods. This process, called gas fermentation, uses captured carbon emissions from various sources in order to create  green chemicals  which can then be used to make household items such as soaps, fabrics, and perfumes  68 . Similar to the making of wine or beer, engineered microorganisms are fed to carbon to produce ethanol, a building block in many products  68 . The practice of capturing carbon and reusing it is an innovation on the rise throughout the world and it further minimizes the impact of carbon emissions that come from typically large sources such as the aviation industries. 6. Readiness Levels and Proposed Timeline With the involvement of the research on the area, hydrogen is no longer being considered just an experimental sustainable replacement to fuel. Companies are now working on reducing the price of hydrogen. Energy company SGH2 is building the world s largest green hydrogen project which will use waste gasification by combusting 42,000 tons of recycled paper waste annually to produce green hydrogen. Rolls Royce has also made successful tests with a 12-cylinder gas variant engine running on 100  hydrogen fuel  69 . Recently, the U.N. launched the Green Hydrogen Catapult Initiative, which brings seven of the biggest global green hydrogen project developers together to try and cut the cost of green hydrogen and increase production fifty times over by 2027  69 . Furthermore, companies are replacing traditional fuel with hydrogen, allowing industries such as the aviation industry, to reduce the negative environmental impact they are causing drastically. Two startups, Universal Hydrogen and ZeroAvia have tested aircraft that have a hydrogen-powered engine under one wing and a conventional aviation fuel engine under the other. Universal Hydrogen used a modified ATR-72 regional airliner to turn a turboprop-powered plane into a hydrogen one which successfully completed a test flight, even cruising primarily on the hydrogen-powered engine for a lap which notably was silent. Although the modified aircraft usually holds 50 passengers, the large liquid hydrogen tank reduces the capacity to about 40. The current technology is being designed for short hauls since large liquid-hydrogen tanks onboard cause regional airliners to only travel about half of a gas-fueled plane s 1,600-kilometer range. The company is remedying this by developing a jet engine that can burn hydrogen for longer-haul aircraft  70 . ZeroAvia used a 19-seat aircraft in its test flight and has raised over  140 million in funding from investors. Also 11 reportedly received over 1500 pre-orders for its hydrogen fuel-cell systems. Commercial launch is expected in 2025  71 . An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that if the rise in carbon emissions doesn't stop by 2025, damages may be irreversible  72 . Due to this, the Target True Zero initiative launched in 2021, which was meant to accomplish three main tasks  to bring leaders together to see different perspectives on alternative propulsion, to help stakeholders take actions to speed up the transition into clean aviation, and to make sure the climate impact of the aviation industry was realized  73, 74 . So far, the Target True Zero initiative seems to be successful, as the US Department of Energy released a Notice of Intent to fund the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that is setting aside eight billion dollars to develop hydrogen hubs in the US  75 . Also seen in 2021, Pratt   Whitney was awarded  3.8 million from Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-e) to develop hydrogen propulsion technology  72 . As a global effort, a new Aerospace Global Forum in the UK has been launched, hoping to accelerate the transition to net zero  48 . A report released by the World Economic Forum, with the University of Cambridge s Aviation Impact Accelerator, claims that by 2035,  Fully battery-electric aircraft could enable completely emission-free flight over the shortest distances. Hydrogen could electrify aircraft with fuel cells over mid-range distances or through direct combustion. Direct combustion can be applied to any aircraft operating any distances flown today   73 . The UK has also led the Aerospace Technology Institute to form FlyZero to find an alternative to traditional fuels, finding that green liquid hydrogen was the most viable zero-carbon emission fuel with the potential to scale to larger aircraft utilizing fuel cells, gas turbines, and hybrid systems out of all other tested fuels. We have also seen the  New Aviation Propulsion Knowledge and Innovation Network  (NAPKIN) release a report claiming that zero-carbon-emission flights on sub-regional routes for aircraft of seven to nine seats are possible within a few years.  73  74 . Progress outside of the United States is also vast, with  HEAVEN,  a project in Spain, receiving funding from the EU to build an onboard liquid hydrogen storage system and integrate it into an aircraft  7 . In Germany, they have started fuel cell aircraft developer H2FLY, saying that it has started final preparation integrating liquid hydrogen tanks into the HY4 test aircraft  51 . The German Aerospace Center has also partnered with Deutsche Aircraft also to integrate a fuel cell system into an aircraft.  7 . We have also seen the Netherlands start a private-public partnership called Hydrogen Aircraft Powertrain and Storage System (HAPPS). They aim to build a hydrogen system that can be used to retrofit existing regional aircraft, which would allow commercial hydrogen-powered planes to take off in 2028  51 . Germany has started fuel cell aircraft developer H2FLY, saying that it has started final preparation integrating liquid hydrogen tanks into the HY4 test aircraft  51 . Governments aren t the only ones to combat carbon emissions, though. In 2023, Honeywell International Inc announced a new technology to produce lower-carbon aviation fuel from green hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from the industry. It would combine green hydrogen and carbon dioxide siphoned off industrial smokestacks to create lower-carbon methanol, which would be turned into fuels. The process could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 88  when compared to traditional jet fuel  76 . Airbus has also recently committed to green hydrogen power, and in 2021, Airbus and Air New Zealand started a joint initiative to research how hydrogen-powered aircraft can help the airline reach its net-zero emissions goal by 2050. Then, in May 2022, Airbus opened a Zero Emission Development Centre for hydrogen technologies in the UK. After that, in June 2022, Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding with  Linde,  an industrial gas company, to work on developing hydrogen infrastructure at airports. They also plan on doing a demonstration flight for the A380 passenger airplane in 2026 using hydrogen fuel cells and burning hydrogen directly in an engine.  51 .      ",,,,,,
The Role of Hydrogen in Aviation Decarbonization (Carnegie Mellon U),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2023 - ""Clean Aviation Energy""",,"Abstract  We are in a race to stop producing harmful emissions like carbon dioxide from every sector of the global economy. Aviation is responsible for about 3  of these emissions,i and 2-3 times more people are expected to be flying by 2050.ii This begs the question  how do we meet future demand and achieve what NASA and the global aviation community have coalesced around, which is a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, in a robust and equitable way? We believe that hydrogen is the answer.iii This report begins by describing the levers that will help us achieve net zero aviation by 2050, including hydrogen s role in the broader decarbonization effort. It then describes the four stages of our proposed hydrogen supply chain  making hydrogen, moving it via pipelines and trucks, storage near airports, and last-mile delivery to the tarmac. Our vision is to connect hydrogen produced at the Department of Energy s Hydrogen Hubs with the nation s 30 largest airports to minimize infrastructure costs and maximize the impacted flight-miles. The report then presents a strategy for bringing the supply chain to life by drawing on key lessons from transportation electrification efforts and offers a timeline that guides stakeholders towards a future where 20  of revenue-passenger-miles are powered by hydrogen. Since our proposal, we have addresses some of the most pressing questions about the transition to hydrogen aviation, including social benefits (emissions reductions and environmental justice, safety, and green jobs), key barriers (water consumption, public perception, and infrastructure barriers), and policy recommendations (demonstrations, incentives, and regulations), informed by an optimization model developed by the team, literature reviews, and additional stakeholder interviews. 1 2050 Aviation Decarbonization Levers The aviation sector produced approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 in 2019. Several studies expect growing demand for air travel to produce over 2 billion tons of CO2 annually by 2050 if a variety of efforts are not employed. These efforts include efficiency improvements, the use of alternative fuels, carbon dioxide removal, and purchasing carbon credits.iv The relative impacts of each of these approaches in achieving net zero aviation is summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1  A list of various efforts that will reduce aviation emissions to net zero organized from greatest to least percent impact Efficiency improvements will be critical to reduce aviation emissions. The Mission Possible Partnership estimates that over the past several decades, the aviation sector has improved efficiency by about 1 . Moving forward, annual improvements of about 2  will be needed to achieve 37  emissions reduction by 2050.3 60  of aviation emissions reductions are expected to come from using alternative fuel sources, including batteries, hydrogen (H2), and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The market share that each fuel type claims will be largely determined by the range it can fly. Battery electric planes are expected to fly the short-range flights ( 500 miles),v H2 planes may fly mid-range flights (500-1,600 miles), and SAFs will likely dominate long-range flights ( 1,600 miles).3 Although SAFs are expected to play the biggest role in reducing aviation emissions, they have two significant downsides  (1) Burning SAFs still produces tailpipe emissions, with the best SAFs reducing Jet A emissions up to 80 .vi (2) The production of SAFs requires vast quantities of land, water, and other resources dedicated to producing feedstocks making a conversion to 100  SAFs unrealistic.vi Because of their decreasing energy efficiencies and increasing carbon intensities, this team believes battery electric planes should be adopted wherever possible, followed by H2 planes, leaving SAFs to fuel the remaining furthest routes. Finally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and purchasing carbon credits will likely play a role in achieving net zero, although their roles should be minimized. These technologies allow airlines to continue producing emissions and then spend money to directly capture carbon dioxide (CDR) or pay others to remove carbon dioxide (carbon credits). In the pursuit of net zero aviation, this team believes the roles of efficiency improvements and alternative fuels should be maximized, and CDR and carbon credits should be viewed as a last resort. Why Hydrogen The U.S. finds itself in a race against time to minimize emissions across all sectors, and the clock is ticking. H2 is a zero-tailpipe emission fuel that comes with numerous advantages  Supply Chain Readiness A significant amount of H2 infrastructure already exists in the U.S.  There are more than 200 steam methane reforming facilities,vii 55 H2 fueling stations in California,viii and approximately 1,600 miles of pipelines dedicated to H2 transport.ix As a result, the technology readiness level (TRL) for H2 technologies is high across the traditional supply chain  gaseous H2 tube trailers and 2 pipelines, liquid H2 trucks, liquid H2 storage vessels, steam methane reformers, etc. While newer production technologies, such as solid oxide fuel cells, are still around TRL 6, they are rapidly advancing and approaching commercialization.x See Appendix Table 1 for more information. Economy-wide Decarbonization Several  hard-to-decarbonize  sectors   including cement and steel manufacturing, heavy-duty transport, and shipping   are betting on H2 to help them reduce emissions. As more H2 is produced to meet growing demand, all will benefit from reduced prices and strengthened supply chains. Federal Funding Availability The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will subsidize H2 production by up to  3 kg through the mid-2040s.xi The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, dedicates  8 billion to the mass production of H2 at H2 hubs across the nation.xii According to Princeton University Professor Jessie Jenkins, this production boost will significantly drive down production costs over time as private and public research advances and economizes electrolyzer technology.xiii Aircraft Performance Hydrogen-powered aircraft can go the distance. While aircraft powered only by fuel cells may be more limited Universal H2 and ZeroAvia s preliminary fuel cell-only aircraft concepts have expected ranges of 600 and 300 nautical miles, respectively hybrid propulsion systems promise to make even trans-continental flight possible.xiv,xv Airbus  combination liquid hydrogen (LH2) combustion and fuel cell aircraft have projected ranges of up to 2,000  nautical miles.xvi In-Flight Emissions Reductions Aircraft powered by only fuel cells would theoretically eliminate all in-flight emissions, with the potential exception of water vapor. Aircraft utilizing LH2 combustion would completely eliminate the CO2 and particulate emissions associated with traditional aircraft but would increase the quantity of water vapor emitted. The nuances of H2 aircraft emissions, including NOx, are discussed in greater detail in the Appendix. Hydrogen Supply Chain Figure 2  The hydrogen aviation supply chain broken up into four sections  Make, Move, Store, and Last Mile 3 Our supply chain is divided into 4 stages  Make, Move, Store, and Last Mile. During the Make stage, gray, blue, and green H2 are produced,xvii predominantly at the DOE s H2 hubs. The vision is to connect H2 from an estimated 8 DOE-funded H2 hubs with a representative version of the FAA s Core 30xviii airports (the 30 largest in the U.S.). Appendix Table 2 lists the predicted hub locations that were used for analysis in this report. Because investing in H2 infrastructure at each airport is quite costly, our strategy is to minimize the number of airports that make the investment by focusing on the largest ones. Once produced, H2 Moves from the H2 hubs to storage facilities at airports, either in gaseous form through pipelines or as a liquid on trucks. We assume that each airport deploying H2 aircraft will Store H2 about one mile away from the tarmac, likely at or near their existing fuel farm. The equipment necessary for H2 storage and usage will include liquid storage tanks, a H2 liquefier if gaseous hydrogen is piped in, and a H2 refueling station if the airport adopts H2 fuel cell ground support equipment and or buses. Finally, zeroemission trucks will transport liquid H2 the Last Mile between the storage facility directly to H2 aircraft that need fueling. Our Plan to Scale Up   Policy Recommendations To bring this supply chain to life, we offer a framework for integrating hydrogen into the aviation sector. This paper draws on lessons learned from the Drive to Zero Program developed by CALSTART, a clean transportation non-profit. So far, 26 countries including the U.S. have signed on to the Drive to Zero Program s Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) committing them to work towards 100  zeroemission truck and bus sales by 2040.xix This section also draws on the proven policy framework developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to commercialize low-carbon technologies. After interviewing both CALSTART s former Executive Vice President and Drive to Zero s Global Director as well as experts at CARB, the team identified five key steps to accelerating the deployment of zero-emission technologies, from transportation to aviation. Step 1  Set Clear, Unifying Goals Explanation  The Global MOU started with a clear goal of 100  zero-emission sales by 2040 based on California s Advanced Clean Trucks Rule and worked backward from there by setting incremental benchmarks.xx Aviation Application  Similarly, our team envisions the aviation community uniting around a singular goal for H2 s role in the market by 2050 and working backward to achieve this goal. Based on our research, setting the goal of 20  of revenue passenger miles (RPM) flown being hydrogen-powered by 2050 seems ambitious yet realistic. xxi, xxii Step 2  Fund Demonstration Projects Explanation  After establishing a goal, the next step was bringing key stakeholders together for demonstration projects. They emphasized that government funding is key to enabling demonstration projects, and  once funding is available, industry will quickly follow.  Aviation Application  In the case of aviation, this will include convening the largest airports, major airlines, H2 aircraft OEMs, H2 producers and transport companies, the Federal Aviation Administration, and nonprofits. The DOE is a likely funding source for aviation decarbonization demonstration projects. Policy Recommendations  Start with demonstration projects. While the Hydrogen Hubs become operational in the mid-to-late 2020 s, we recommend the DOE administer a request for proposals (RFP) for airlines to fly commercial hydrogen flights between two to three airports. Ideally, these airports would be fueled by nearby H2 hubs. These demonstrations would take place around 2035, providing several years to install infrastructure. Match funding by airlines would 4 likely go towards subsidizing the cost of the aircraft and hydrogen transport, storage, and liquefaction infrastructure. Step 3  Replicate Successes Explanation  Once the initial demonstrations projects are operational, the key lessons should be identified and replicated. They noted that  industry alone cannot push progress fast enough. Government incentives and regulations are essential.  Aviation Application  Best practices from H2 aviation demonstration projects should be paired with incentives and regulations to accelerate H2 adoption at the Core 30 airports. Policy Recommendations  After a successful demonstration project or two, then incentives should kick in followed by regulations a few years later. Incentives could subsidize the upfront cost of hydrogen aircraft, airport infrastructure investments, and or the price of H2 flight tickets (i.e., make hydrogen flights cheaper than conventional flights to boost public interest). Interestingly, Universal H2, a leading H2 aviation startup, recommended subsidies go towards renewable electricity generation, electrolyzer costs, and water desalination to benefit cross-sector low-carbon H2 commercialization. Regulations could include an aviation-wide carbon tax or cap and trade system. They could also include a phase-out of the sale of jet fuel aircraft similar to California s Advanced Clean Trucks Rule that gradually bans diesel bus and truck sales. Two additional policy interventions that we recommend are reforms to speed up the permitting process for energy projects as proposed by Senator Joe Manchinxxiii and federal guidance towards approving hydrogen transport by rail. Step 4  Education of Airport Employees   Public Outreach Explanation  Public engagement is key to a successful large-scale transition. Aviation Application  Airports are notoriously low-risk environments. For H2 to be effectively integrated into an airport environment, both employees and the public should be well-educated about how fueling, aircraft appearance, and safety procedures will be different for H2 than they are for traditional Jet A fuel. Step 5  Cultivate International Cooperation Explanation   Decarbonization is an international effort.  Aviation Application  Expanding H2 aviation beyond the U.S. will help decrease costs for all and increase the eventual likelihood of international H2-powered flights. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) already exists as a pledge between countries to reduce aviation emissions and would provide a platform for H2 to become a part of the global strategy.xxiv Timeline to Success Conversations with CALSTART thought leaders inspired this team to establish its own goal of 20  H2 RPM by 2050 to work backwards from.xxv Several H2-powered aircraft manufacturers, including global OEMs like Airbus and startups like Universal H2 and ZeroAvia, are expected to bring H2 aircraft to market between 2030 and 2035.14,15 In the meantime, several milestones must be achieved across the H2 supply chain to enable H2 aircraft to scale up rapidly once they are deployed. The team developed the timeline below to help guide the transition. The national vision can be found as Appendix Figure 1. 5 Figure 3  Timeline of milestones to achieve 20  domestic H2 RPM by 2050 Optimization Model To more robustly explore the nuances of a H2 supply chain, we developed a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model that is a mathematical representation of our framework. Our model finds the set of nondominant solutions for supply chain configurations that balance the tradeoff between cost and emissions with a series of real-world constraints. We derived three key findings from our model results, which we summarize here and expand upon in subsequent sections  1. Political initiative is needed to fundamentally minimize uncertainty surrounding costs, emissions, and reliability of the hydrogen supply chain, offering better decision-making capabilities for modelers and decision-makers alike. 2. Infrastructure development must account for both pipelines and trucks in the future aviation hydrogen economy. In the near-term, trucks will likely dominate as a nimbler, cheaper transportation option. In the long-term, pipelines offer a cost-effective, reliable, and loweremissions option to deliver high volumes of H2. 3. For green hydrogen to play a more dominant role throughout the U.S., zero-emission electricity generation prices will need to come down and novel regulatory strategies will need to be invented to incentivize truly net-zero forms of hydrogen production. Figure 4 below shows the final outcomes of our model which selected an optimized network configuration for the four stages of our supply chain while balancing cost and emission objectives. We varied the weight of these objectives (preference weights) with a term called alpha (  ) which ranged from 0-1  where 0 indicated fully optimizing for emissions  and 1 indicated fully optimizing for cost. In order to account for variability within the network, we ran this model over three discrete cumulative distribution functions for H2 demand which we called market capitalization scenarios. This plot captures the opportunity cost of building the cleanest supply chain network  calculated as the cost difference between the most and least emissive configuration  for each market capitalization scenario. This information is essential to decision makers deciding how to configure the supply chain and strategizing how hard to push for H2 penetration into the aviation fuel market. We see that for the base case, the annual opportunity cost is roughly  60 billion (2050 USD)  for the mid case,  146 billion  and for the high case,  256 billion. This information is especially critical given that some industry experts 6 consider anything below 80  H2 market capitalization of domestic aviation fuel consumption by 2050 a catastrophic scenario for the climate and industry as a whole. It begs the question of whether we will have the political and social will to invest in the most carbon neutral future possible. Figure 4  Pareto efficiency frontier for alpha  0.3,0.95 , balancing tradeoff between cost and emissions over different H2 market capitalization scenarios. Differences in cost and emissions between base and high market cap scenarios are  737 billion per year and 145 tonnes year CO2, respectively. Multiple optimal points are chosen per each alpha, which we resolve to model setup. Alpha range in final presentation truncated due to spurious outcomes resolved to modeling semantics. See appendix for details. Supply Chain Logistics Through extensive data collection and using some of the internal calculations of our model, we have answered 4 Key Questions about H2 integration into the aviation sector for the 30 largest airports in the country (representative of the Core 30). Production, transportation, and storage costs were estimated using the quantities of H2 calculated under the 20  domestic RPM scenario detailed in Question 1. Additional details, calculations, and the full list of the 30 airports analyzed can be found in the Appendix. 1. Is it realistic  Can the 30 largest airports in the continental U.S. alone be responsible for making 20  of all domestic revenue passenger miles (RPM) be powered by H2 by 2050? If so, what percentage of their yearly RPM would need to be powered by H2, and how much H2 does this translate to? Yes, if the 30 largest airports each power about 27  of their annual RPM with H2 in 2050, H2 would power 20  of total domestic RPM. This would require between 11 and 17 MT (megatons) of H2. A conversation with an engineer at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) revealed that CARB predicts a H2 hub in their state would produce approximately 16 MT year of H2 by 2045. If these numbers prove true at all hubs (or even close to true), then meeting 20  H2 RPM would demand less than 15  of H2 hub capacities nationwide. As shown in Appendix Table 2, the H2 hub expected to supply the most H2 to airports is the one located in CA, and airports would demand less than 10  of this hub s total capacity. 2. Fuel Cost and Emissions  What are the cost and emissions implications of each color of H2 in comparison with Jet A fuel? Thanks to generous IRA H2 production credits (up to  3 kg), blue H2 is expected to become cheaper than jet fuel,xxvi and both green and pink H2 become cost-competitive with jet fuel. As technologies like electrolyzers and small modular reactors used in making green and pink H2, respectively, increase in production and efficiency, all H2 types may become competitive with jet fuel. We also see that green, pink, and blue H2 emit less than 1 3 the emissions of jet fuel. 7 Figure 5  Expected costs and emissions of energy-equivalent quantities of H2 fuel and Jet A fuel for the  average  airport 3. Transport Cost  What are the CapEx costs associated with procuring pipelines or trucks to connect H2 hubs with airports? Are trucks or pipelines more cost effective? Figure 6  Total CapEx costs for transporting H2 to three airports that demand different H2 quantities  LAX (551 million kg), CLT (184 million kg), and IAD (102 million kg). We find that it is likely more cost effective for airports to select one transport method for delivering their H2   either as a gas through pipelines or as a liquid via heavy duty trucks   since the infrastructure complexities and CapEx costs required for each are so large. For the 30 airports considered, we find that their annual H2 demand (under the 20  H2 domestic RPM scenario) can each be met by one 36  dedicated H2 pipeline. Lastly, we find that the most cost-effective option for the 26 largest airports is pipelines, and that the remaining smaller airports should use trucks (see IAD in Figure 6). This largely has to do with the quantity of H2 demanded at an airport and the distance from an airport to its nearest H2 hub. See Appendix for additional details. Also note that while we analyze battery electric trucks here, fuel cell trucks are rapidly improving and may be another viable option. 4. Storage Cost  Assuming a 25  on-site storage requirement, what is the CapEx cost associated with on-site liquid H2 storage at airports? At the highest H2-demanding airport (LAX), an estimated seven on-site 3,218 m3 capacity LH2 storage spheres will be needed at a cost of around  54 million. Spherical, as opposed to cylindrical, storage tanks are used to store especially large volumes of LH2, and the dimensions and costs of those used in this analysis come from the National Renewable Energy Lab s Hydrogen Demand Scenario Analysis Model (HDSAM).xxvii At the lowest demanding Core 30 airport (AUS), only 2 spheres would be needed, for a total cost of around  15 million. These costs represent a lower bound, as they 8 only include the expected price of the storage spheres and associated piping and pumps, not labor or licensing costs. While expensive, Pittsburgh Airport and LAX are currently investing  1.5B and  6B in new terminals, signifying that airports are no strangers to hugely expensive expansion projects. Social Benefits Emissions Reductions and Environmental Justice It has been shown repeatedly that the effects of climate change most often impact marginalized and lowincome communities.xxviii Making H2 the clean fuel of the aviation industry will help to catalyze the hydrogen economy which promises to bring decarbonization to many high polluting sectors. From an end-use perspective, the benefits are universal. Airports with H2-powered ground support equipment (e.g., airport cargo loaders and wide-body aircraft tugs) and planes will make for cleaner, quieter airports   reducing the pollution burden of flight operations on nearby communities.xxix The benefits of production are not as clear cut. As Figure 7 shows, green H2 production is prioritized under preference weights that prioritize lower emissions. These preference weights also correspond to ranges for which the results of our model are most unconfident due to the prior-mentioned compounding of uncertainties when      0.3 and      0.95 (see Appendix Figure 2). Our results indicate that for green H2 to be more of a contender with blue H2 when optimizing for cost, the per unit cost of green H2 must come down. Additionally, we find that in the presence of insufficient accounting of regional resource constraints or emissions equity priorities, federal optimization (e.g., based on cost) will result in homogenous hydrogen production methods across the entire country. This may not equitably distribute benefits of clean (green) H2. The result being that certain regions may be excluded or unintentionally selfexclude from the larger green economy  retrenching distributional emissions harms. Figure 7  Average quantity and type of hydrogen production over all probabilistic scenarios for the given priority weights. Green hydrogen production is chosen for the most uncertain, emissions-prioritized regions. Pink hydrogen serves more as a transitional method of hydrogen production. Blue hydrogen would be the most dominant form of production over a range of priority weights. Safety Another social benefit is that H2 is safer than jet fuel with respect to its impact on human health, environmental safety, and risk of fires. Whereas direct exposure to jet fuel can damage the liver, immune system, skin, and cause cancer, H2 is neither toxic nor carcinogenic.xxx From an environmental safety lens, jet fuel can remain in soil for over a decade and leach into local groundwater. H2, on the other hand, is likely to rise into the atmosphere and disperse because it 14 times lighter than air.xxxi Finally, H2 poses less of a fire risk than jet fuel. H2 is less likely to ignite than fossil fuels because it requires significantly higher oxygen levels and temperatures. If it does ignite, H2 fires pose less of a risk than jet fuel fires because its flames burn upwards rather than circumferentially causing less damage to surroundings. H2 also radiates much more slowly which decreases the risk of H2 fires spreading to insulated components in the case of an airplane fire. xxxii 9 This is not to say that H2 is completely safe. Safety precautions for H2 deserve serious attention, especially because H2 leaks easily and burns with an invisible flame. Given that the U.S. has over four decades of experience handling H2, H2 safety is not a new research area. Several organizations, including the Center for H2 Safety and the Hydrogen Industry Panel on Codes, have worked together to create robust H2 safety measures.xxxi H2 will likely be deployed in several new sectors over the coming decades, which will require close monitoring and the advent of new safety measures. However, it is ultimately a massive leap forward from jet fuel in terms of safety. Green Jobs The blossoming H2 economy will create vast new employment opportunities. These jobs will span the supply chain, including areas such as CCS technology, electrolyzer and fuel cell manufacturing, pipeline installation, and the multiple end-uses of H2. What truly sets H2 apart from other alternative aviation fuels is that it will be deployed in so many sectors beyond aviation, including transportation, industry, and shipping which means that the jobs created will not be niche - they will be highly transferable, long-term employment opportunities that span multiple sectors.xxxiii These jobs are already beginning to emerge. 20  of the application for the DOE s Hydrogen Hub funding is a Community Benefits Plan which requires applicants to consider labor engagement, workforce development, diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and the federal Justice40 Initiative which ensures 40  of federal investments flow towards disadvantaged communities.xxxiv, xxxv Rather than recreate the wheel, the aviation community has the opportunity to invest in H2 and scale up the green jobs already being designed to lift up communities most in need. Key Barriers Water Consumption The three H2 production pathways the DOE is funding through their H2 hub network pink, blue, and green each consume significant water resources. Assuming the use of light water reactors, pink H2 requires the most water, approximately 76-85 gallons of water per kg H2 produced. Green H2 is not nearly as water-intensive, requiring 19-28 gallons per kg H2, xxxvi because solar and wind do not require water to generate electricity unlike light water reactors. Blue H2 requires the least water at 8-12 gallons per kg H2. In this case, the water usage comes from several different sectors  the natural gas supply chain, cooling tower, and electricity.xxxvii, xxxviii, xxxix Based on the projected 2050 demand for H2 from the domestic aviation sector alone, we estimate the maximum water required at H2 hub to exceed 88 billion gallons year (see Appendix for details on this calculation). This means states will have to allocate a significant portion of water resources to H2 production, a difficult task for regions with pre-existing water stress. One example of an already-stressed state is California whose water demand exceeds 110  of available water supply.xl One potential solution for California and similarly stressed areas is the desalination of rivers and seawater. Reverse Osmosis (RO) has achieved a TRL of 9 with large-scale application globally, including 35  of Israel s freshwater coming from RO desalination,xli which demonstrates its ability to help address water scarcity issues. Public Perception Public acceptance of the use of H2 in aviation is an important factor that, if not addressed, can become a barrier to commercializing hydrogen aviation. To understand the role of public acceptance of H2 projects, we reviewed the work of Iana Iacob, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University focused on public 10 perception of the hydrogen hubs and hydrogen aviation. Without public acceptance, hydrogen projects are at risk of facing pushback due to NIMBYism and environmental concerns. Numerous surveys indicate that the public s key concerns surrounding H2 relate to safety, regulation, and oversight. This applies to all stages of the supply chain, meaning that the public would like to see safety guaranteed by regulations and oversight for hydrogen production, transport, storage, use in aircraft, and CCS technology. Research also suggests that the public is largely unaware of hydrogen as an energy carrier. This offers hydrogen stakeholders an opportunity to craft the narrative surrounding hydrogen. We recommend that hydrogen stakeholders and government proactively collaborate on hydrogen safety regulations over the coming years so that when hydrogen demonstration projects begin, the hydrogen community can point to existing regulations to help foster public trust. Regulation will specifically be key to enabling hydrogen transport via interstate pipelines, the primacy to store CO2 underground for CCS technologies, and the storage of H2 safe from attacks. Infrastructure Barriers Both pipelines and electric or diesel trucks pose their own unique challenges as H2 delivery methods. Pipelines have much longer lifetimes and lower emissions per kg of H2 delivered than trucks. Despite steep upfront costs, pipelines can be a very cost-effective option for delivering large amounts of H2.xlii However, there has historically been significant resistance to the construction and installation of pipelines spanning large areas, for reasons such as geopolitics, ecological damage, exploitation of Native American lands, and drinking water contamination.xliii,xliv,xlv And even if a route was designed such that each of these concerns were addressed, a pipeline can take up to ten years to construct.xlvi A Senior Director of Operations at the San Diego Airport told the team that switching from delivering Jet A fuel on the tarmac with trucks to an underground pipeline system caused huge disruptions and including gates needing to close temporarily. Despite these drawbacks, there are over 1,600 miles of H2 pipelines already in existence in the U.S., and pipelines are by far the most common delivery method of jet fuel to airports.xlvii Trucks present a more flexible option. They do not require the permanent alteration of huge swaths of land, eliminating the huge time sink of route design and licensing for pipelines. Furthermore, they can be cost-effective options for customers who demand low to moderate quantities of H2, and some studies have found them to be cost-effective (relative to pipelines) for longer delivery distances.xlvi, xlviii On the other hand, adding trucks to the road increases congestion, which in turn impacts the safety of all vehicles on the road, the quantity of vehicle emissions released into communities on roadways, and travel times. At busy airports, increased traffic on airport-access roads and the tarmac could pose a concern to airport operations. Furthermore, trucks delivering liquified H2 suffer from the  boil off  of LH2 where liquid H2 increasingly escapes over time. A representative of Universal H2 told the team that a possible solution is to establish a strict window 4 days was suggested in which H2 is delivered and used by aircraft. Conclusion Decarbonizing our economy is the challenge of our generation. If we are to minimize global warming as fast as possible, we must coalesce around a unified and realistic decarbonization vision. H2 emerges as a promising solution for decarbonizing aviation because it is projected to offer transcontinental, zeroemission flights and is already supported by high supply chain readiness and federal funding. We find that connecting the Department of Energy s H2 hubs with the 30 largest airports creates a reliable source of H2 supply and demand that would both help achieve NASA s 2050 net zero aviation goals and help spur cross-sector decarbonization. H2 offers improved emissions reductions and environmental justice, safety, and transferrable green jobs. By addressing its key barriers like water consumption, public perception, and infrastructure challenges with proven policy initiatives, we believe H2 offers the best chance to decarbonize aviation and the broader economy.",,,,,,

As new pandemics arise, they will likely impact aviation in a negative way, e.g., new restrictions to slow the spread of the pathogens, resulting in a loss of revenue (fewer passengers flying) and additional operational costs (mitigation measures).   What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?   Real-time monitoring of air and passengers to detect pathogens, as well as enhanced filtering of air flows.   What trends might enable problem exploration and solution?   Spread of new variants of COVID and new pathogens will motivate incentivize problem solution.   Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?   Billions of passengers per year, all around the world.   Impact - What is the scale of the impact? (high, medium, low)?  High impact, given the extensive reach and importance of aviation to the global economy.   Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations?   Medium.   Effort   what is the effort scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-ARMD NASA aligned?   Large effort to solve this big problem, which has a strong aeronautics connection  hence CAS-worthy.
